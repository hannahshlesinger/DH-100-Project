Listen, as a brown woman of course I gave Rupi a try - that's what we brown girls do, we hold each other up and support each other like crazy because who else will? However, I think we should also be able to speak up when the work just doesn't cut it. Being critical is simply tough love - so don't be so quick to dismiss my negative feeback.First of all, half of this book are one-liners from her first book, and most of her longer pieces felt lazy and ill-thought out. I found myself skipping/ losing interest through most of them. Furthermore, I just can't ignore the more popular pieces she has claimed as her own when any avid reader can tell you they are not. Example 1 : ""you must see no worth in yourselfif you find me worth lessafter you've touched meas if your hands on my bodymagnify youand reduce me to nothing"" - rupi kaursounds awfully familiar to my favorite quote by Kaija Sabbah:“If you consider a woman less pure after you’ve touched hermaybe you should take a looks at your hands.”Example 2: (This is from her first book) ""She was music, but he had his ears cut off"" - Rupi Kaur""She was like a piano in a country where everyone has had their hands cut off."" - Angela CarterExample 3:""a manwho cries""- rupi kaur""i want more men with flowers falling from their skinmore water in their eyesmore tremble in their handsmore women in their heartsthan on their bodiesmore softness in their height more honesty in their voice more wonder more humility in their eyes.""- Nayyirah WaheedExample 4:""Your voice does to mewhat autumn does to treesyou call to say helloand my clothes fall naturally""- rupi kaur(Okay aside from this just being hilarious, here's who she tried to copy)""I want to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees.""- Pablo Nerudaand""You wonder why I don'tanswer your 3 a.m. phone calls.When you say ""I miss you""I begin to undress myself out of habit."" -Sierra DemulderExample 5:""If you got any more beautifulthe sun would leave its placeand come for you""- rupi kaur“Had I told the seaWhat I felt for you,It would have left its shores,Its shells,Its fish,And followed me.”― Nizar Qabbani(Many of you have messaged be about the difference between plagiarism and inspiration, and this is my take on it:If ms. kaur is attempting to give a voice to women through her work, which she claims she is doing, then she should also acknowledge everyone who has ""inspired"" her. The debate her isn't whether she's a good poet or not, but if she has any integrity....which she clearly doesn't. Many women of color writers, specifically black women writers, have been silenced by her. This is the same woman who ""wrote"" the following:""I am the product of all the ancestorsgetting together and deciding these stories need to be told""???? How??? By erasing them? By taking their words and signing your name underneath them?and my favorite,""never trade honesty for relatability""Congrats y'all, she played you.)The pieces speaking about some of the hardest topics seem so surface level, I felt wrong reading it. I would never give this to my daughter. Not to mention the randomly sprinkled poems talking about her being an immigrant, all of them felt so out of place and awkward next to her other pieces. Anyways, I could go on and on about how much her work mirrors the work of lesser-known authors, but I think most readers already know this. I feel let down and embarrassed by this author and would never recommend it to anyone. I can only hope she grows up one day and finally finds her voice.",1664,default,[]

The last chunk of this poem just made me cringe and it also ruined the initial emotion I felt while reading the first half.---Next up, buttercup:i envy the windswho still witness youBeen dur, done dat. How is this original? I bet Atticus would love this one. ---Please, Queen Latifah, give me da strength that I need to get carry on. Here we go again:you break women in like shoesYou know what? I've made a grave mistake in reading this. This isn't my preferred cup of tea.---The end is nigh:amanwho cries- a gift I came. I saw. I conquered. ---It's over, finished, done, finito, caput. Welp, that was definitely better than milk and honey. NOT! But in all honesty, none of her poems really left an impression on me. There were a few ""poems"" that I liked, but I've already forgotten them. Also, I thought this collection was meant to empower women? Majority of her poems came across as emotionally insecure and overly clichéd. Here is why I have a problem with her work: corresponding imagery is nice to look at once in a while, but I picked this up to be moved by her WORDS. If I wanted a picture book, then I'd go out and buy one. I found the artwork in this unnecessary, and I wasn't impressed with the stick people drawings.Also, I think modern poets tend to forget how impactful the use of punctuation can be for a reader. Create a tonality with your words and format your stanzas with stylistic elements. Unfortunately, this whole book was very dull and very monotone.It is nice to see a young Canadian poet establish herself--don't get me wrong! And my heart goes out to Ms. Kaur after reading about some of the horrific situations she underwent. That being said, I still think her work is overhyped and resembles little fluffs of nothing. If you enjoyed this then no hard feelings. But no more chances and no more modern poetry for me. I mean it. (that's probably a lie)*sings* Edgar Allan Poeeee sum sugaaa on meee.PS.

Like m&h, there were a few lovely nuggets in here, but it was long and drawn out, redundant, and it felt like she had a minimum page number she had to get to, and like another reviewer said, a lot of her content looks very familiar/like she paraphrased existing quotations and such already. The bad far outweighs the good.I mean, I guess I can give her props for expanding beyond the tumblr one-liners, but even her longer poems I didn't like. She basically took a regular conversation, got rid of all capitalization, and added misplaced punctuation so it became sentence fragments. Some of the illustrations are lovely. And then some are a bit perplexing (like the drawing of what I'm assuming was a woman going down on another woman under the poem talking about the moon and water.

Let me say I had low expectations going into this, but I was so wrong. Backstory: I'm not a fan of milk & honey. It's not a style I enjoy at all, and the entire book just felt too Tumblr and cheesy and simplistic. this blew me away. it's so different, fresh, and jaw-dropping.it’s interesting to see how her writing has grown and evolved. there are very few short poems (unlike m&h), which i was thankful for, because in m&h it seemed like she would just write sentences with skips in it, then label them poetry, and i really hated that style. however, this utilized a lot of longer poems and metaphor and personification of nature, and although it’s still not my favorite style, it’s gotten so much better. This book was just so much more personal. m&h felt like a ton of blanket statements and tumblr posts, but this one had quotes that actually made me sit back and go “whoa.”“i even tried to bury myself alivebut the dirt recoiledyou have already rotted it saidthere is nothing left for me to do- self-hate”AMAZING.This book adds on an entire section about immigration and refugees, and I thought it was new and powerful as opposed to only talking about feminism, the body, and self-love. also, brown girls NEED to pick up this book. there is so much positivity and messages about acceptance of your skin. i will say, if you decide to pick this up, don't give up hope until you reach part 2. The whole first part seems like it was a step back from milk & honey? milk and honey was so feminist and focused on recovery and self-love and some of the poems in the first part were like “TELL ME I’M PRETTY I NEED VALIDATION” and stuff like that and I was like ??????? It started out really weak but definitely got better.Lastly, another thing I wasn’t a huge fan of is none of her poems use punctuation. She had some longer poems unlike anything she had in m&h, but most of those just employed really long-winded run-on sentences and I wasn’t a huge fan of that style. Because of that, it was hard to tell sometimes when one poem ended and another begun because none were punctuated, some didn’t have titles, some were just one sentence, etc. Regardless, I'm sorta speechless because I expected to hate this and I actually enjoyed it so much. Several of the poems gave me chills. If you gave up hope after milk & honey, definitely think about trying this from a library or something because it is a MAJOR improvement and I think its messages are valuable, and nothing about this feels like a regurgitation of a Tumblr post.",128,default,"['read-in-2017', 'poetry', 'feminism', 'favs-of-2017']"

Divided into five chapters and illustrated by Kaur, the sun and her flowers is a vibrant and transcendent journey about growth and healing. Ancestry and honoring one’s roots. Expatriation and rising up to find a home within yourself.Kaur's voice is as audacious and brave as ever. She nails to perfection the specific intimate details that made her writing so achingly real in milk and honey. We have poems exploring self-love, self-hate, body-image, girls supporting girls, motherly love, feminism, insecurity, sexual assault, and so much more. I read through it in a whirlwind. I barely put it down, and it was so short I didn't even have to.The author's smart, poised, and down-to-earth writing oozes inspiration. And I'm beyond eager to share some of my favorite pieces: 






















































I'll never grow tired of reading Kaur's passionate words. And I hope there's more and more to wait for in the future, regarding her poetry.

I love what she advocates in her poetry collections, what she stands for. How it is told in a format of stages, of growth. Following on from her previous collection (not that it is a sequel, but the format and themes are similar), the sun and her flowers is tackling the root of our own emotions and suffering, to taking it in and accepting the people around us, our ancestors and our heritage, our immigrant parents, to ultimately establishing self-love.

There's a rich narrative to be explored there and I'm glad she devoted an entire section for it. Other than that, many of the poems are a hit or miss. Sometimes Kaur weaves together profound thoughts, and other times she simply write statements that have line spacing every other word. Half of the poems are about heartbreak and relationships, which I found to be generic. I can see how this would be meaningful to young girls though; my younger self from 5 years ago probably would have enjoyed Kaur's poetry more, because I dealt with emotionally abusive relationships back then.

As a big fan of poetry I love to find new poets who inspire me and make me question my own view of the World. I enjoy reading poems that are hard hitting and don't shy away from the brutality of the World today. Rupi's poems in this her second book are written with love and from the heart. The offer a glimpse into the life Rupi has lead and the trials and tribulations she has gone through to get where she is today. You get the impression Rupi is still learning how to be a woman and an adult. She's still trying to find her place in the world. I love Rupi's style of poetry. It's simple yet also very beautiful. Rupi illustrates her poems with simplistic drawings that help to get her point across. This latest collection touches on sex, abuse, culture, religion, gender etc. The stand out poem is called Home. This poem is striking and quite frankly amazing. It's worth getting the book just for this poem alone. The use of description within this piece is just outstanding. A truly phenomenal piece of writing. Be warned Home is a brutal poem. It's not a pleasant read but it's a poem I believe every woman should read no matter what their circumstances are. Rupi has the ability to pack a hearty punch even when she is only writing a short poem. She has a clever knack of choosing just the right words to make the biggest impact possible. Reading this book makes you appreciate life. It makes you question the choices you make. It makes you sit up and take notice of subjects you might not normally read about. Rupi isn't afraid to open her heart to the world. This collection was inspiring and energizing. Wonderful reading. ",48,default,[]

“I hear a thousand kind words about me and it makes no difference yet I hear one insult and all confidence shatters - focusing on the negative.""
This quote was like a punch in a gut. I felt guilt, shame, and realization when I read it because honestly, I am like that. Rupi Kaur did it again. Her brutally honest poems stirred up something inside me. A year ago, I read milk and honey and I was quite surprised of how personal, vulgar and relatable it was. But this book? I personally think it is better. 
LOVE. LOST. PAIN. PERSONAL DEMONS. GRIEF. TRAUMA. FEMINISM. SACRIFICE. HAPPINESS. REDEMPTION. RACE. MOVING ON. HAPPINESS.
She wrote poems about these issues and she successfully reached my heart and soul with every poem. I admire how straight- forward she is, with every word she uses; it was so moving and gut wrenching. Her writing is commendable because of how true, vulnerable, fragile, frank, and relatable it is. Her poems are direct and blunt. The writing style is simple yet gripping. As per the illustration, some of it were easily understood while the others kept me thinking because of the confusing way it was drawn. I personally think that the author wants the readers to conjure what the drawings mean.I'm excited for her next work, Rupi Kaur is one my favorite poet.

I didn't want to jump onto the bandwagon either way. As a South Asian woman myself, I wanted to give her a chance, and so I really took my time reading The Sun and Her Flowers. Honestly though? I think her work is very, very average. There are some poems here that I, as both a South Asian woman and an expat, could relate to. But it's really nothing to write home about. The sun and her flowers is a collection of poetry influenced by the Gurmukhi script (Sikh script used to write Punjabi) and so its written entirely in lower case. Kaur's poetry is divided into 5 parts dealing with various themes on womanhood, relationships, and immigration: wilting, falling, rooting, raising, blooming. Wilting- talks about the pains of ending an unhealthy relationship and dealing with the aftermath. This part was the least appealing to me. Kaur covers the whole spectrum of emotions in her relationship drama and I really just couldn't deal with that unhealthy mess. Falling- deals with some very personal issues like depression, rape, loneliness, insecurity, trauma, body issues, slut shaming, family conditioning, self harm, self love, etc. It was my second most favorite chapter in the book as it dealt with a lot of issues that's very common among South-Asian women. I was specially drawn to the pieces on body image and ownership. Even though these issues are behind me now, I still remember the struggle to reconcile my family's conservative notions with my own personal autonomy. And Kaur does an adequate job of capturing those feelings. Rooting- Perhaps the part I related most with, it talks about immigration, refugees, motherhood, female infanticide. It was a tribute to those immigrant parents who left their countries in search of a better life, and the sacrifices they made for their children. It was a tribute to those parents who never fully adjusted to their new lives. It was perhaps the most emotive part of the entire collection; there is a sense of deep rooted sadness and melancholy threading through the pieces Kaur writes in this section. It just reminded me of my parents. Rising-Covers new healthy relationships, starting over, healing, sex, intimacy, commitment, marriage, long distance relationship. Bloom-feminism, sisterhood, acceptance, and empowerment. It didn't talk about anything new, but covered a lot of the main hot topics. It felt like a cliched call to feminism without delving deeper into the root of these issues. Kaur writes the way she illustrates her poems: in short, jerky bursts outlining the raw idea behind her poetry, but seldom giving it enough depth or dimension to be really evocative. Her poetry is very simple and superficial even though she deals with some heavy subject matter. There's just not enough to dissect below the surface. What you see is what you get.In this regard, I found reading her poetry like a story, an autobiographical glimpse into different aspects of Kaur's life, was a far more interesting experience. The sketches added to the visual storytelling, letting us see the poet's interpretation of the different themes. The lower case style of writing is nothing original. I got used to it after a while.All in all the sun and her flowers is a very average collection of poems. I can see why it would have mass appeal for its simplistic writing style and tumblr-esque relativity. I just expected something more. 2.45 Stars.",36,default,[]

""i do not weep because i'm unhappy, i weep because i have everything yet i am unhappy.""
Holy shit, I enjoyed this book even more than Milk and Honey. This is a collection of poetry divided into five chapters: wilting, falling, rooting, rising, and blooming. The poems mainly revolve around grief, self love, self hate, rape, immigration, feminism, depression and empowerment. My favorite parts of this poetry collection were the longer poems that told a story and had a thin black box surrounding it. My two favorites are home and the art of growing. Those are both incredibly powerful poems about rape and feminism that really hit home for me.
""i can't wrap my head around the factthat i have to convince half the world's populationmy body is not their bed i am busy learning the consequences of womanhood when i should be learning science and math instead.""
The main reason I liked this collection of poetry more than Milk and Honey is because this collection reads like a story, and it has so many amazing and insightful poems about immigration and feminism that really moved me. I loved the stories about her parents and the struggles they overcame in America, and how she isn't ashamed of who she is, and you can really tell she thinks the world of her Mother and I think it's so beautiful. Especially the poem about female infanticide really struck a chord with me and made me really depressed. She effortlessly covers such controversial topics in these poems and it's so refreshing, her voice is so powerful. 
""they leave and act like it never happened, they come back and act like they never left.""
I just feel really inspired and empowered after reading this. I feel like the main theme of these poems is summed up perfectly by this one poem: ""how do i teach myself to accept a healthy love if all i've ever known is pain."" This collection of poems is about falling out of love and finding someone new and I like the way it kind of reads like a story in that way. I am just blown away by how powerful some of these poems about feminism are and some of them gave me fucking chills and I loved it.

I am Ded rn.2. IT WAS SO GOOD (as if you couldn't tell by my rating)3. This hit my feels dead centre4. It's 2:07 AM5. And I need sleep  You know those poems that dig trenches at the bottom of your heart and plant ache and sunshine so your heart is simultaneously pumping hurt and love into your veins? This is what this book did. My heart is aching. My heart is loving. I can't form coherent thoughts. I am shook.Gosh, I don't even know where to start. This book. The poems. The content. The emotions. Omfg.I read Milk and Honey last year and while I loved the richness, the emotion, and the rawness of it, I was unceremoniously bothered by the poetic structure, which in turn took a lot away from my reading experience because I was trying to depict what the random 'enter spaces' meant. The 'hitting-the-enter-button-every-couple-of-words' tactic came up again in The Sun and Her Flowers but somehow it made more sense? The content of the poems overpowered any itty bitty itch that scratched at my English-major heart. I felt so much with this book that I was easily able to look past any questionable structural choices.The themes of the book followed the same pattern as Milk and Honey, where we have chapters that start from heartache and end with empowerment. I ached in sorrow for the majority of the book but also felt nourishment, care, and power. I loved the realness of each chapter and almost every poem, how the words seemed to sink deep into my stomach and then all of the sudden burst from my chest, and the tears that formed three times and my audible ""YAS GIRL YAS"" at some instances. My 
favourite
 poems had to be the ones about the immigrant experience, rape, family, and heartache... which is basically the whole book but still. I loved everything, and I'd share all the poems and verses I bookmarked but I'd end up sharing half the book! Oh, and the illustrations. They were simply perfection. So much detail, so much profundity in their own right; I devoured them. Also, I was just casually listening to Spanish music and eating Timbits while reading this, and if you know anything about Spanish music and Timbits is that they make you very, very, 
very
 happy. The kind of happy that doesn't know what reality and sadness is. Well, I can confidently say my happy was slammed down to reality while reading The Sun and Her Flowers. Because how can someone have tears in their eyes while listening to reggaeton music and eating dough-balls full of joy? I'll tell you how: this book. If any contemporary poem can break through the epic, lit-vibes-inducing, euphoric combo of Spanish music and Timbits, it'd have to be one of Rupi Kaur's. I can't wait to see what she has planned next! Absolutely loved this collection!

I have yet to read Kaur's first collection of poetry ""Milk and Honey"" but for me, reading this book has certainly encouraged me to do so sooner, rather than later.These poems were so refreshing, true and straight from the heart.

Some definitely stood out more than others, and I found myself giving them a second or third read, as the words had such a big impact on my heart.

This book has an entire section dedicated to immigration and refugees, which I thought was hard hitting, and poignant, and extremely relevant to what is occurring in the world today. There are beautiful poems about accepting the skin that you are in, and loving yourself, despite your flaws. I think the best part of this collection was the second half of the book. I am no poetry expert, but this was excellent stuff. My only complaint, if you can even call it that, was the severe lack of punctuation. The poems just flowed, with no stoppage time.

Actually, both THE SUN AND HER FLOWERS and MILK AND HONEY were on it and I purchased both for them. Then, I thought to myself that poetry is one of those things that speaks to the individual and often in ways that we don't discuss with each other. So, I wanted to know why she requested them in hopes of peeking into her inner psyche and wandered to my local library site to see if it was available to loan--it was, but the wait time was going to be a couple months. Fine. I wasn't in any rush.I really don't feel capable of critiquing it on a technical basis. I read poetry. I know what I like, but do I have any true understanding of how to analyze it for fundamentals--no. Therefore, this review will focus on its visual elements, the drawings, and the emotional response it evoked. The book is divided into subsections. I'm just going to quote the 'About the book' blurb for concise reference because it's spot on. The sun and her flowers is a collection of poetry about grief, self-abandonment, honoring one's roots, love, and empowering oneself. It is split into five chapters: wilting, falling, rooting, rising, and blooming. It is female oriented and speaks to the challenges we face in ourselves and the world which attempts to define for us what ""women"" is. There are some wonderful insights, whether or not its great poetry I can't say, but it is definitely the sort of thing you can open and reflect on the struggle and triumph discussed within it.

Is it feminist? If being focused on a women's perspective is your sole defining characteristic of feminism then yes. But, I think this is more about individual self-worth and agency. Some times this felt almost hackneyed, like aphorisms, but it had a well-thought out trajectory and the drawings that accompanied were lovely. Some intriguing continuous line drawing and they help to focus the mind on the intent of the words. I think the more torn, and probably younger, at least closer to the age of the author or twenties then this is more powerful. That said, I can easily recommend it to several friends I know who are double that age, if for no other reason then remembering your own struggles and how you've persevered is a good reflection. 3.5 Stars",15,default,"['2018-odyssey', 'poetry']"

Kaur’s second poetry collection suffered from a lack of coherence within its sections, and from digression from its own stories. The basic story is a tale from heartbreak to depression to love to hope for the future. Within that framework, Kaur digs into other, deeply personal struggles, from her sexual assault to the struggles she has with her body. Her most impactful poems are those about these very personal experiences, digging deep and using careful imagery to draw out the moment and metaphor. There are standouts. On page 76, Kaur draws herself a bath after she has been sexually assaulted. On page 90, she ruminates on how she was raised to think she could not say no. On page 105, she uses one of her thoughtful illustrations to amplify the message of a poem on self-love. Unfortunately, many of these standout poems get lost in a lack of coherence and organization. The Sun and Her Flowers is split into five sections: wilting, falling, rooting, rising, and blooming. But these sections drift, digress, and spin out into other topics. The poems within them could work in one theme if they were ordered in a more careful way, but they seem vaguely gathered and thrown into the same buckets instead, and so we swing from topic to topic. The sections themselves aren’t the issue—with thought, it’s clear how sexual assault, problems with your body, self-hate, and depression could all connect—but the order of the poems within each section, that leave the readers swinging from one theme to the next and back rather than building to a central theme, or than following a single storyline. The collection also suffers from triteness in several places. Very general, worldly poems about women’s strength or refugees are interesting, but drag the reader out of Kaur’s story, which is otherwise so personal. A poem about Kaur’s female ancestors is an example of a good balance of this, while poems about climate change in the middle of her concluding section about hope and new love are good examples of where I feel these trite poems fail. The best chapter is also the shortest: “rooting” is unified and tells one, miraculous tale. Kaur enters a chapter dedicated to her mother, and to the struggle of immigrants and immigrant parents in particular. This section holds some of the strongest poems in the collection, and works well and coherently on its own (although it does seem like a digression in the story being told by the collection as a whole). I think it benefits from its brevity: the poems can’t be as scattered as in other sections, so “rooting” is able to tie itself together with care. ",15,default,['poetry']

I come across many reviews saying that “putting random spaces in the middle of sentences isn’t poetry”, and others saying that it’s the best poetry they’ve ever read. I, personally, don’t think it’s fair to tell someone that their poetry doesn’t count because it clearly does. But again, poetry is subjective and opinions are too. The only thing I don’t agree in is those who say “this is for people who don’t read real poetry”. There is no need to insult people for their tastes - if you like Plath, that’s good for you, but don’t insult those that prefer Rupi Kaur’s style. Remember: poetry is subjective and highly in line with a persons’ individual taste and you have no right to judge that. Nobody deserves to have their reading tastes belittled or insulted, no matter what it is. Now that I’ve put across my two cents in regards to that issue, on to the actual review:This collection of poetry, to put it bluntly, was nowhere near as mind blowing as Milk and Honey. I deeply resonated with Milk and Honey and fell in love with the book as a whole, but this one found me struggling in areas. Though my copy is heavily tabbed for the poems that I really enjoyed or made me feel things, I don’t feel the same connection to it as I did with her first collection. I think it just didn’t have the same impact. I also partly believe it’s because the topic of some of these poems weren’t as relatable to me personally as ones in Milk and Honey.I also feel that some of the poems were simply too short. Some were too short to connect to and even though I understand that it may have been a spur of the moment blurt of feelings, it just felt incomplete. I’d read it and wonder where the rest of it was and in numerous places I was actually wondering if it had been used as a filler. But, that being said, the majority of this book was very good, well written and thought provoking - regardless of whether or not I connected on a really deep level or not. Every single poem evoked some kind of thought in me and to me, that means that the collection as a whole was incredibly successful. No, this one isn’t as good as Milk and Honey, but I would still wholeheartedly recommend you giving it a read - particularly if you’ve read her first collection and enjoyed it. Maybe this can give you more than it gave to me. The key thing to remember is how subjective poetry is - I might have interpreted some of the poems differently to how you would’ve, so it is always important to get your own opinion. I did enjoy the illustrations - I love the characteristics of the illustrations and I love how they’re “imperfect” and not overly refined; I love how well they marry together with the poem itself and together, they make the perfect duo. I always find that the illustrations adhere perfectly to the poem itself and really enhance the reading experience. On some occasions, the illustration spoke to me a little more than the words did... I found that the poems that had illustrations with them were some of my favourites, actually. Though this review hasn’t been overly positive as such, I feel like it’s difficult to portray the positives in regards to a poetry book without going too personal - the reasons that I liked some of these poems are incredibly personal. But I liked the imagery, the language, the layout and the overall meanings displayed throughout these. I think that, overall, they’re really successful. I did enjoy this book and will no doubt go back to my favourites again because they really did stick with me and nestle deep into my heart - that, to me, speaks volumes for how successful this book is.

Rupi Kaur might be an amazing human being but she is not an amazing poet. Period. Her book is filled with incoherent sentences broken down into several lines in the name of poetry. I am sorry, but that is not poetry.There are several undiscovered poets out there who write authentic poetry and do justice to the genre who aren't getting the publicity they deserve because people have decided to over-hype certain muddled works. As far as my knowledge goes, Kaur started off on Instagram and met fame there. Good for her. Not good for the literary world. It hurts my eyes to see something like this getting widely accepted as poetry, I have seen amateur authors on wattpad write better poetry than this which I actually love to read and would love to see getting published. Trying to act tumblr-y and writing 'poems' on sensitive and popular social issues is sadly the key to getting famous these days. For me, this is one of those cases. According to William Wodsworth, “Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility.”In this compilation of so called poetry, there was nothing spontaneous, nothing was powerful and nothing in the forced words had the power to move me. 1/5 from me.

No offense, if you are going to publish a collection of poems, the least you can do is make them differ. The Sun and Her Flowers is a compilation of poetry about grief, love (especially family and motherly love), and self confidence. Split into different sections with wilting. falling. rooting. rising. and blooming, collected into one indicating the process of growth just as the title suggests. The only section I enjoyed was the last section ”blooming”. The writing in this particular section was intricate and well placed into sentences telling a purposeful story within each one.

Some of the things that she talked about I couldn’t even fathom happening to someone. It really made me have to stop and think about how my life is compared to hers. After finishing the book, I felt like I could relate more to this one than I could to Milk and Honey.

Since I closed it's covers, I feel as if I truly hate myself. Not just myself, but the world as a whole and everything in it. Some would say that the great versifiers of our world's history had the ability to, at any level, make us feel things we hadn't felt before, to teach us things. These things could've been about ourselves or perhaps about human nature and the pains and battle of life itself. I've never been one for poetry, but the words of John Milton in his profound sonnet ""On His Blindness"" have always been the definitive example to me of what poetry should be. In his words, Milton speaks about the shortcomings in life that we all face. He relates those shortcomings to his own blindness, a hindrance that battled his every ability in life. When faced with this disability, Milton shines like a optimistic sun after a thrashing storm. He views his blindness as a ""mild"" downside to a greater purpose in his life. You must read the poem at full-length, but it is clear that Milton expresses that our troubles in life do not make us, but are used to propel us to something greater. You might wonder what this has to do with my review of ""The Sun and Her Flowers"". Well, this book taught me nothing about anything, all it did was make me wish I was blind like John Milton.

Comparatively, I found this second collection of poetry to be lacking and underwhelming compared to the first. For starters (and clarification), I think that Rupi Kaur is a talented artist. I enjoyed her first book so much, I actually gifted it to a couple other people in my life, as I found it to be almost like an advanced exercise in empathy with universal value. I know her writing style has been criticized for lacking refinement, though given my own background from an immigrant family, I really enjoyed how she embraced writing in lower cases and phrases as a form of artistic storytelling. When you learn a new language, anything short of perfect diction is commonly seen as unpolished, so it was refreshing to see a style in the vein of polish-remover being utilized as its own aesthetic.I also really enjoy her at times brutal, at times tender, brand of extreme honesty. This ultimately led to, what I considered to be, a really refreshing form of authenticity in milk and honey. Sadly, in comparison, the sun and her flowers feels almost like an underdeveloped afterthought that could have used some additional germination (terrible pun intended). I appreciate many of the sentiments Kaur shared, but this particular stream of consciousness felt unrefined in terms of any substantive direction. Rarely can style alone make up for deficient substance. That said, I’m afraid I was not a fan of this one, though I am likely the minority opinion. I doubt this will deter me from future work from Kaur, but it does leave me disappointed in the meantime.Rating: 2.5 stars",7,default,[]

Yes, I think so, but this wasn’t the poetry collection for me. I do like how accessible Rupi Kaur’s poetry is - it can be read by anyone. The illustrations are chef’s kiss - though some could be triggering so be aware. I feel like poetry should feature art alongside the poem itself. There are no trigger warnings at the front of this book so I basically went in blind - I will say that there’s TW for rape, discussions of rape culture, mental health, especially depression, loss and trauma. But it’s also about love, healing, motherhood, legacy, immigration, womanhood and consent. ",7,default,"['2020', 'scribd']"

They make it, political is personal. They take everything to heart which is understandable, but there's something genuine lacking when that is the case. There's a political cry in something personal. People on the internet need to stop pandering this progressive, woke stance to garner attention. I believe honesty and vulnerability is more important. Which I know many reviewers believe that is Rupi Kaur's intentions which I have nothing to say about that, but, sadly, it falls short. Everything she wrote is way too general. There is more to dive into, there has to be. Instead of her writing about how she wants to be in the present over and over, how about describing the present around her. How does she wake up? What surrounds her home? What's inside her home? What does she do to relax or when she's alone? I think people need to stop describing themselves like warriors and survivors and definitely stop making themselves victims and instead open up. Tell me who you are. All I know about Rupi is that she is a woman of color, but you can just google search her for that. Everything is so vague. There's nothing deep here. I wanted to think that as a poet she will develop and become a better writer. Unfortunately, I think she is regressing, because this is the same stuff she has been selling. But, hey if it's not broken, don't fix it right? Oh wait... Doesn't she hate capitalism? The hypocrisy. If she truly, TRULY, hates the system, HATES capitalism, she would have gone balls deep into this. She would have broke all boundaries, took a chance on a new writing style. You can't stay stagnant as an artist. Yes, you can have a style, but it's fun evolving and she claims she changes every month. Well, it's not being shown through her writing. Share a moment of time with your readers. Don't lecture them. Don't tell them things they already know. Yes, the earth is heating up. Yes, there is racism. Yes, the world is chaotic and no one will live forever. Not you. Not me. Not your mother or your father. We all experience pain. No one is special. Depression and anxiety are everyday occurrences. We are all apart of this experience. But, who are you? That's what matters. Who are your loved ones? What are some of your bad habits? What are you interested in?Stop wasting paper, Rupi. You literally wrote a vague poem on climate change that could be ripped off of anyone's twitter account.

Not because it was so enchanting & fantastic, but simply because the poems were SO. SHORT. As a fan of Rupi’s long-form poetry, I’m disappointed with this collection honestly. It felt rushed. I felt like she *touched* on many deep topics, but did not dig that much into them. I kept thinking “Where are her words? Where is the grit?” It all just felt a bit like reading a page full of Instagram mantras. I’m really not trying to be pretentious... This is obviously just my personal opinion. I still love Rupi & think her work is incredibly necessary for keeping poetry alive on a mainstream, digestible scale, but this just didn’t do it for me. I dog-eared pretty much all of the longer poems in this because they were GREAT! I just wish there were more of them included. This collection could’ve been half the size if it didn’t include the filler, “Instagram poetry” as we now have learned to call it... But that is what Rupi is! She has a huge IG following & understandably caters to what will be reposted from her books. Complaints aside, I enjoyed the structure of this collection a lot & hope to read more poetry that’s broken up like this. It was split up into “MIND | HEART | REST | AWAKE” sections. She touched on many important themes like depression & anxiety, sexual trauma, friendship, productivity, having immigrant parents, feminism, representation, & healing. This was a collection about coming home to yourself & treating yourself with the love & respect you deserve. This book contains important mantras for young women who need to realize their worth, but it was just nothing special for me personally.",102,default,[]

My younger self would have been obsessed with her words, found healing and solace within them.This collection is similar to Ms. Kaur's other volumes of poetry. The poems are short, sometimes one phrase, and drawings are scattered throughout the book. Like her other work, these poems deal with topics such as anxiety, dissociation, depression, lack of self worth, abuse, and reminders to be gentle with oneself and that there is hope for healing. There are also some poems describing the emptiness of capitalism that I appreciate.The shortest poems are often the most profound. Nuggets of wisdom and insight packed into the tiniest of packages.Home Body would make a wonderful gift for young women on your list, especially those who are struggling to overcome abuse or sexual assault, or simply struggling to find, to love, and to accept themselves in a world that consistently places unrealistic demands upon young women. A world that determines her value by how much she produces or what she can offer to a man. Though I think young women would benefit the most from Rupi's words, I recommend this book to anyone struggling with issues of self worth or past abuse. These poems are not something I personally need at this time and Home Body's similarity to Rupi's previous books makes this a 3-stars read for me.

I was in awe. She has undeniably been through more in her life so far than anyone should have to go through in an entire lifetime. She truly has a way with words, and provides insightful commentary on impactful topics.It’s a shame that she wastes her talent on these 2012 Tumblr poetry books.Modern poetry, in general, is not my thing. (But, to be fair, ancient poetry is also not my thing. Wherefore art thou, likable poetry?) I find it more gimmicky than anything else.especially whenthey writetheir sentenceslike this.These short, few-word phrases cut up into an “aesthetic” format elicit little to no emotional reaction from me. Most of Kaur’s poetry falls into this category and, furthermore, disregards basic capitalization and grammar rules. (Although, to be fair, so do my reviews. At least I’m not charging you guys for this crap.) But when she does take the time to write more than a couple of words at a time, she actually produces some half-decent work that did resonate with me, a least a little bit.There were two poems in this collection that I genuinely enjoyed. They were:
silly little girllittle angellittle devilso oblivious tobeing the miracle workeryou are the motherthe magicianthe master of your life
(Page 188) and...
sometimesi love you meansi want to love yousometimesi love you meansi’m not sure how to love yousometimesi love you meansi’m not sure how to leavesometimesi love you meansi have nowhere else to go
(Page 51).Personally, I would have thrown in some punctuation and capital letters, but hey! Pretty good, right? This just shows how much Kaur is capable of, but the vast majority of her work seems to be semi-meaningless phrases strung together and “artistically” vomited onto a page.There were also some minimalist drawings tossed into the mix, some of which were beautiful, but all of them felt like unnecessary page fillers. Even still, there were so many empty or half-empty pages. I sympathize with the trees who died for all of this wasted page space.

But there will never not be one moment when you don't feel.. something. The special. Even though a lot of the topics Rupi wrote about aren't anything new, it felt good reading this book.

It’s a reminder that so many of us go through various difficulties, often feeling hopeless but it doesn't mean we should give up fighting. She didn't.The verdict.

The art doesn't judge itself, people judge the art. So with that being said I believe Homebody deserves a five star rating. Rupi Kaur just wrote another book that reflects her own unique experience in life. For that she did great expressing herself...I can now note what I did or didn't like about this collection....Like the 2 books Rupi wrote prior to Homebody, she exemplifies a particular style of poetry that is considered ""instapoetry"". Personally I like the style of being able to read through a plethora of thoughts to gain one big perspective. It's almost like a movie that is made of random clips of life that doesn't have to be in chronological order....Homebody has a lot of art illustrated by Rupi. That alone always magnetizes me to read her books. To me, some of her illustrations are slightly child like...but for some reason I enjoy them and the creativity behind them. I don't think as many illustrations existed in Homebody like the last 2 books Rupi has written. Regardless, they are very nice to look at....I did enjoy the long stories in Homebody...as someone who is darker skinned, it makes me feel that people from other nationalities can also relate to some of the pain that comes with being a darker skin in America....All in all ""Homebody"" is a book you can quickly breeze through to see perspectives through Rupi's life...I mean that is what poetry does regardless. Homebody is like ""Milk & Honey"" and ""The Sun and Her Flowers""....it was just a different way to explain part of Rupi's story.

Long review.Rupi Kaur touches on so many important topics but her work lacks serious depth. This collection felt like a dull repetition of milk and honey  and the sun and her flowers. Even though I find her openness about personal trauma and mental state courageous, unfortunately it is not enough. In my opinion her work is overhyped. She writes (with very few exceptions) cliché poems that give the illusion of depth when in fact they are lacking any real political or literary agency. The mode of writing is not new and I am happy she introduced Western whites, like me, to this mode of poetry even though I am not particularly touched by it.The broad ideas in her collection are powerful, exactly because of their universality, but the execution is just not. She capitalizes on that. Good for her, don't get me wrong! but this is not poetry. Also, I find it disappointing that her work does not foster public discourse. She conveys a simple and very agreeable message and it ends there. She is not engaging with us! I am not even sure she actually can. Her goal is accessibility but poetry has never been about *simplicity* and *mass culture or readership*. It was interesting to read her take on a trans-inclusive feminism. As she is often so fixated on her womb and the ""female energy"" that comes out of it, I have thought many times that she excludes trans women by doing so. Maybe if she had written more than 3 words regarding this topic, her views would have been more clear to me.The sun and her flowers might have been her best one so far. ",18,default,[]

The first one, Milk and Honey, feels so many worlds away from this book. Admittedly I didn’t enjoy milk and honey; I just found it a little shallow, superficial and lacking in depth. Perhaps it was a little young for me. But I gave her second book a chance and I’m glad I did as The Sun and Her Flowers was a big step up for me. I enjoyed the different layers and exploration of race and identity. And then this book felt like another step; the honestly about her sexual abuse and how it affects her. What is most interesting too is how a lot of her sexual abuse happened during childhood, and yet she didn't touch on it too much in her first two books, or at least not as explicitly as this one. I’m honoured Rupi has chosen to show us this vulnerability and allow us insight into coming to terms with traumatic things that happened in the past, and how that trauma has affected her in the present day and the abusive relationships she’s had in adulthood too because of it.To me, milk and honey was her teenage years, the sun and her flowers was her becoming a young adult, and home body is her transformation into adulthood.So what I actually liked most about this book was not necessarily the book itself, but the transformation we’ve witnessed over the three books. I think it’s fascinating to have three books hold testament to the witnessing of maturity, vulnerability and self-exploration with age.I'd still love a longer read as I find her books just far too short. And I found this book quite jumbled in places, jumping from self-love to white-privledged, then back to relationships. So once again, it wasn't a book I'd keep (borrowed it from the library), but overall, I always try and focus on the feel of poetry rather than the analytic side of it as poems don't always need to make sense; they can be messy or short or random, and yet for some reason, still hit you deep. So often you don't need to make sense of the poetry much less than you need to make sense of why you felt it.",15,default,"['nonfiction', 'feminism', 'poetry']"

Her first book was written when no one was watching; when no one was cheering her name. And so she wrote in honesty and truth. This third book reads like a) Rupi needs a good Trauma Therapist and b) she’s trying to forcibly recreate the success of her first book. She talks in two poems about being scared she'll never write anything as good as her first book. About how she’s worried she’s just recycling the same thoughts, again and again. These are the two most honest poems. She's spent her last two books, writing derivations of her first, as if that will produce derivations of the same success. It doesn’t.Declarative Statements as Poems; a few examples:i am not my worst daysi am not what happened to me- remindernothing can replacehow the women in my lifemake me feeli am careful aboutwho i spend my energy on- i know my worthour elders are not disposable i am not interested in a feminismthat excludes trans womenThose aren't poems. At least, not to me. There’s no hidden meaning, no play on words, or metaphors or similes or anything. They are just statements. I’m done reading Rupi Karr's work. This book left me feeling sorry for her and worried that she’s not in the right kind of therapy. Also, where are her friends? Does she have people in her life giving her honest critiques of her work? Because this book feels like it was written by an author surrounded by YES people. It left me thinking she should write a memoir, for all the declarative statements she’s making.

It’s her aesthetic, I guess.Themes include: rape, love, depression & anxiety, global warming & feminism.The last part of this book is mainly only feminism,global warming, lgbtq+ support.

I usually fancy poetry with lyrical verses and rhythmic nuances, but Kaur style is more to free writings, zero poetic metaphor and too straightforward. Home Body divided into 4 chapters-- mind, heart, rest and awake which delved into the past and present, of love and survival, acceptance and embracing changes. The idea was okay but the lack of literary metonymy and allegory also the unrhymed format (although I could see that few having assonance) somehow making the collection not really resembling poetry but more to written prose and short narrative telling. It speaks a thought and an event which I favoured cause of its strong proposition in viewing life (I prefer rest chapter out of all) but perhaps the simplicity of the diction did not suit me that much, no matter how much it attempts to portray the writer's emotion (even with all the illustrative images) still it feels 'empty' and dull to me.

It's not enough for poetry to keep us engaged, to entertain us. It must make us feel something. And while this collection did do something to me, it failed to really engulf me enough to stop questioning whether these flat one liners count as poems. Like:
masturbationis meditation
Kaur's third collection of poems, released seven years after her break-out debut milk and honey, is divided into four parts: mind, heart, rest and awake. They're representing the voice of someone who is now twenty-eight years old and who's slowly preparing to leave those roaring 20s behind her, though she's still on a journey of self-discovery and reconciliation. A lot of this just seemed utterly trivial. Yes, being alone and lonely aren't the same things. It's a nice realisation, a comforting one even, but something that I didn't need Kaur for. There’s a lot redundancy, too – she's playing with the idea that depression and anxiety make you go quiet while simultaneously feeling very loud in your own mind on various occasions for example. There’s a new shade to her writing now, as she seems more concerned with growing older now and is hit with a new wave of appreciation for her parents and the elderly. She now also has to grapple with fame and having people have certain expectations of her. Turns out none of this is particularly helpful when you're suffering from depression. Unhealthy relationships still seem to be her thing. There are poems about molestation and abuse in here, which are gruesome for what they imply, but there is also heartbreak and reflections on former relationships that seemed to have left their own share of bruises. Sometimes she seems to have found answers to her worries, sometimes she seems baffled at her own reactions to things.

Maybe I didn't get much from this, because I have made such different experiences. I know what backlashes feel like, but I have never thought of anyone I have been involved with as a predator. Maybe it's also that I process things differently than her audience does. She writes about productivity guilt for example, which I feel like I can relate to, but knowing that it isn't an experience singular to my existence doesn't really help or console me.",5,default,['poetry']

Now, i don’t read much poetry at all and would not be able to tell you what’s an objectively ‘good’ poem or otherwise, and i know i’m not alone in that. Hence why i think Kaur’s works resonate with so many - they’re beautiful, yet accessible and could probably be considered as a ‘gateway’ to the genre. That doesn’t mean that her works lack depth, but those who are more familiar with poetry may just have other preferences.Out of the 3 books, Home Body feels like the most intimate as a lot of the pieces are built on Kaur’s personal experiences and reads like a memoir. Some of the ones that stood out to me were the ones that talk to her parents’ immigrant experience as well as ones where she addresses her productivity anxiety. Outside of those, she also covers a host of other topics like relationships, capitalism, depression + anxiety and trauma. I enjoyed the collection as a whole, although i did find some pieces more affecting than the rest.

'Home Body' is no different. In this book, Rupi Kaur talks strength, positivity, nostalgia, love, strength, abuse, misogyny, optimism, and so much more. It's a short book full of short poems, but each poem will ring true and will make you think of what it means that it rings true. It makes you reflect on your choices while giving you a different perspective on how choices affect human beings other than you. However, I must say that some one or two liners (also some of the 4-liners) in there aren't poetry, plain and simple.

It was nominated for Goodreads Choice Awards Best Poetry before it was even published. The long awaited next release by Rupi Kaur had proven to be, personally, a disappointment.I appreciate the move Kaur has made to publicize and speak about trauma (sexual assault, abusive relationships, immigration, and the overly demanding nature of our capitalist society). I also appreciate her normalization of sex and sexuality; but this, to me, is not a poetry book.The modern take on poetry, more often than not, is not what poetry is supposed to embody. The ""social media/ insta poetry"" devolved poetry as a genre.Poetry, for me, is the most intricate explanation of the ineffability of human experience. It is the evocation of that ""feeling"", like magic, being transitioned from the writer to reader. home body is a plain-faced, bluntly put, short speech of her life and trauma.If this had been marketed as a cohesive short story book, some stories as short as a sentence, I would probably be more into it. home body feels like a lightly illustrated diary entry. Even stated in a few of her poems: this feels like a rushed, forced, ""poetry"" book filled with overt themes to be a shocking spectacle for press coverage and meet a publishing deadline pressured by an agent.I believe Kaur has better work than this to make and offer to the world.The only pieces that felt poetic were as follows:pg. 85, ""there are years in me that have slept""the 6th stanza on pg. 89 from the piece entitled ""Productive Anxiety""pg. 90, pg, 106, pg. 103pg. 137 ""my body renews itself in waves of ocean and blood""Maybe if I was 15 years old and this was one of the only poetry pieces I had ever read I would think it to be ""deep"". Maybe it would have spoken to me, or taught me lessons I did not already know. And this book could prove to be very important to people in that age range, because when I was 15 there weren't books like this.But, as a successor to milk and honey, it simply does not live up to the beauty and grace, and raw passion. milk and honey had much more of a cadence. The first two poems in that work gripped me, made me want to read more. There were metaphors and similes that I could feel in a way that cannot be described in plain terms. Hence the need for poetry. I could feel the vibration Kaur was putting out in milk and honey. The illustrations were in the same style, but were companions to the pieces to enhance the work in a way home body did not deliver.milk and honey still incorporates language plain enough to be digestible for all readers, but there is still that spark that is unique to poetry as a genre. The poems in milk and honey that are blunt are in juxtaposition to her more artistic poems. home body lacks these artistic works.

If you didn't know it before, Kaur makes it explicitly--and I mean explicitly--clear in her third collection of poetry, Home Body. At this point, I pick up Kaur's poetry in hopes of understanding what makes them sell, without much expectation to enjoy her writing. Of course, Kaur is doing the full time work of being an artist, writer, and poet and her ability to put out three bestselling collections of poetry in a short time is a testament to that. I think that Kaur's books sell massively because her poems are universally accessible, straightforward, direct, and addressing topics that feel relevant and necessary to discuss in today's society. Home Body continues this streak of accessible, bite-sized ""Instagram poetry,"" as Kaur explores her usual themes trauma, sexuality, and femininity. She adds in a heavier exploration of the immigrant experience, racism, environmental issues, and sex in this third collection.However, for me, Kaur's popularity is a catch-22: the same aspects of her poetry that make it marketable are what make it forgettable and subpar. I am always judging collections of poetry by how long it takes me to read them and Home Body was a 45-minute cover-to-cover read. These are simply not poems that force readers to pause, think, or reflect. The majority of them are incredibly short or lacking style or structure and, in my opinion, do not do their topics--or their writer--justice. They touch on really difficult themes like heartbreak, abandonment, and trauma the way that an artsy Tweet or an Instagram caption would and then they move on. Many of these poems are almost cringe-worthy in their vulnerability, which, unfortunately, comes off as performative in the absence of a deeper exploration of the mindsets, processes, and healing behind the experiences. In Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead, Brené Brown says: ""Vulnerability is based on mutuality and requires boundaries and trust. It's not oversharing, it's not purging, it's not indiscriminate disclosure, and it's not celebrity-style social media information dumps. Vulnerability is about sharing our feelings and our experiences with people who have earned the right to hear them."" What has Kaur required her reader to do in order to earn the right to hear about her most vulnerable experiences, except pay $17 for her book?Throughout Home Body, there are glimmers of what Kaur could write if she didn't limit her in-print self to to poems the size of an Instagram post. In there's no place more intimate than bed, Kaur actually ""does"" poetry, personifying her bed into a close friend or a lover. Kaur touches on generational trauma--without saying it!--between productivity anxiety, where she speaks about her unrelenting need to feel as if she is working, and a lifetime on the road, where she tells the story of her father, who was a long-haul trucker, and worked through a burst appendix. In poems like friendship nostalgia and where the depression came from, Kaur gives herself the time and space to delve deeper into some of the themes that she otherwise just touches on in shorter poems, ultimately creating a more effective piece of writing. Most of the poems, which are more aptly described as mantras or musings, are not particularly revolutionary. ""Masturbation is meditation,"" while holding a lot of ideas to explore about femininity, secrecy, sexuality, and shame, does not actually do anything except suggest that Kaur, herself, is illuminated in ways that her reader is not and that she isn't willing to give the reader an opportunity to illuminate themselves. These little one-liners leave me feeling unfulfilled and unable to explore the ideas put down on the page. At times, I felt Kaur's tone was contradictory. On page 134, Kaur talks about the difficult journey she has undergone to arrive to where she is at now and comments: ""and you want to take my seat. the one I built with the story of my life. honey. you won't fit. I juggle clowns like you. I pick my teeth with fools like you for fun."" Then on page 161, she says: ""we get scared that another woman/ will take our spot/ but space doesn't work like that/ look at all the men in the arena getting stronger/ as their numbers multiply/ more women in the arena means/ more room for all of us to rise"".Ultimately, many of Kaur's poems feel contrived or, worse, already done. The final poem she leaves readers with is:now that you are freeand the only obligation you are underis your own dreamswhat will you dowith your timeThis is eerily similar to Mary Oliver's The Summer Day which ends:I do know how to pay attention, how to fall downinto the grass, how to kneel in the grass,how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fieldswhich is what I have been doing all day.Tell me, what else should I have done?Doesn't everything die at last, and too soon?Tell me, what is it you plan to doWith your one wild and precious life?Favorites from this collection (by page number in the physical book): 8, 16, 31, 40, 60, 88, 92, 101, 109, 114, 143, 159",4,default,[]

I also definitely do NOT want to read about how the sacrament of Baptism is a euphemism for oral sex. Go away, ew, thank u next. It was seriously disturbing. Speaking of which, I couldn't really relate to that many of the poems. The only ones that resonated with me were the ones about depression, anxiety, and the environment.

However, I think this could be a good source of healing for those who have just gotten out of an abusive relationship.

What a reliefto discover thatthe aches i thoughtwere mine aloneare also felt byso many others

This was way better than the author’s other collection, Milk and HoneyHome Body managed to touch my feelings, challenge my thoughts and open my eyes and it did than beautifully and emotionally.

I have never known anything more quietly loud than anxiety

The collection is divided into 4 sections and covers a lot of themes like mental health, self-love, feminism, trauma, and loss. I was moved deeply by the first two sections and I felt a powerful bond with the author’s words. They were raw and naked and full of meaning. I enjoyed a lot of what she wrote in those sections and I was totally engaged and drawn to the deepness of it all.

There are years in methat have not slept

Unfortunately, I didn’t feel as connected to the last two sections and that really affected the reading experience as a whole. While I felt completely invited into the intimate journey of the author in the first two sections, I felt a distance in the last two, Like I was kept at arm's length unable to embrace or deeply see the significance.I really wish I felt equally enamored and moved by every section in this collection but I still enjoyed it immensely and I appreciate the courage and the vulnerability of every single word and how inspiring they could be.

 but every experience I’ve had, is memorised in my flesh, even if my mind forgets, my body remembers, my body is the map of my life, my body wears what it’s been through, my body signals the alarms when it thinks danger is coming

This year, I’ve been on the journey of finally waking up to see my own true self for the first time and realizing that you’re never really done growing but that it’s just an evolution- and accepting that has been the best thing I have ever done for myself.

This is my first Rupi Kaur book (and the first poetry book that I've actually purchased on my own). I loved how sincere and honest Kaur was in her poetry about herself, the world, and our relationship with people. I loved the four divisions in the book and seeing the progression of our darkness to acceptance. It was hard to read ""mind"" at times, relating to the words and feelings that I work so hard to erase and suppress in my life. While ""mind"" was a difficult part to read, ""rest"" was such a divine section of the book. I felt so understood as my complicated self always struggle to put my thoughts into words. I think it's also where I am in my growth to finding myself, relearning what ""rest"" means for myself. Overall, many of Kaur's poems pierced into my heart and I had to read the same lines over and over again at times for some reason. Maybe due to the amazement that my thoughts have finally found the words, or to just take another read to fully understand, whatever the reason, each page was given a second glance. It's not easy finding people that understand you and maybe that's why we all search for books about made-up people, but with such personal and real stories shared by Kaur, I wonder why the people who seem to know me best are people I will never meet at all.

There is a lot more to think about in this book, it felt deeper and most robust.The division between sections was clear and I really felt the different tones; this is something I felt she was unable to accomplish before. Home Body also includes a couple of multi-page poems which is something I didn't expect to see but was delighted by. I am glad to see Kaur experiment in form, straying from her genre-defining short poems into a more classic structure.My personal favorite poems were those about female empowerment, friendship, and anti-capitalism. I still struggled with her poems about romance/dating/relationships. Kaur's lived experienced is so vastly different from mine I did not relate, and almost felt like an outsider.

Kaur discusses issues such as sexual assault, abusive relationship, immigrant lives, self worth, feminism, political issues and POC rights through the poems she wrote.

I think Home Body is more ""timely"" (I hate that word but that's the most accurate one to use) than her previous works in its relation to its themes of self analysis, actualization, assurance and productivity, but I still think it will age well as reflection is not a one time event for anyone. As for form, I've always thought that it was incredible how she made kind of a form for herself (lowercase, pictures, short length, etc.) in poetry, but I've always had a deep love of her longer ones. In Home Body, I think the two longest poems (""productivity anxiety"" and ""a lifetime on the road"") really shine as reflections of the struggles of working life from her father's as a truck driver to her own as a poet, artist, and performer.Regarding her shorter pieces, I think a lot of them were still powerful, giving more insight to Kaur's mind, both the things that changed (her success) and lurk (her childhood) but also uplift (her acceptance of herself) and inspire (her [female] community).

While reading, it almost felt like she was overcompensating for the poor writing and poor substance of the topics she covered. The actual syntax and writing bothered me. It did not seem like her punctuation/line breaks were meaningful. Her lack of punctuation was frustrating (it didn't add to the meaning, it just seemed like she did that to make it more complex, but I think she missed the mark). Her line breaks also were not powerful. Overall, it was just confusing to read because I had no idea what her poetry structure was to inform her meaning Overall, I would not recommend this book.

I feel like the strongest thing I can say about ‘home body’ is that it feels the most like her, the most raw, the most stripped and honest and personal: her precious two books had some kind of pretentiousness, but in this one it feels like it’s all Rupi and no magic tricks or manoeuvres. It really is an ode to how she found her voice and came into her own as a whole, and I love how she tackles the complexity of how she matured with the profound simplicity that she has become so known and loved for. I especially loved the second half, with part three being the most relatable and part four being the most reminiscent of both ‘milk and honey’ and ‘the sun and her flowers.’ It definitely didn’t disappoint.

The brevity of Milk and Honey was poignant. The movement towards happiness in The Sun and Her Flowers was a refreshing reinvention within the same style. Home Body feels like a very exhausted person collected the closing thoughts of long run of new age therapy sessions. Nothing is untrue or irrelevant, but neither is it inspired.Kaur’s themes are of course with exploration, but she seems like she’s tired of them herself. There are a few stand out poems that exceed the micro-stanzas of the rest. They tend to be the ones where she looks up from the affirmations of her own psyche, trauma, and sexuality and into the lives of others. I’m interested in all those things, but on their own are not especially compelling. It may be important reading for others (and certainly important writing for her own wellbeing), but I’m most drawn to how she she’s the others in her life. My favorite was the one about her father driving truck, and coming down with a serious medical condition. Another was about her mother’s work as a housewife and the complex feelings that Kaur had about her as a child. I was more of that.I’ll almost certainly read her next book, but I’m not going to be evangelizing this one like I did her others. ",2,default,[]

Right now Home Body is divided into 4 parts (in order): mind, heart, rest, awake. Mind is very personal, explicit, and intense. I was almost overwhelmed and a little triggered, so I would have preferred to be eased into the intensity. I would recommend: rest, heart, mind, awake. I also felt Rest was the strongest part.

I'll start with the positives: 1) Her poetry is accessible for new poetry readers 2)the images evoke a Dr. Suess but grown-up type of nostalgia 3) almost every poem and image is easily instagrammable for a populous obsessed with the performance of reading poetry and ""self-actualization"". Now that being said, the negatives... Kaur ignores every rule of creative writing, choosing to tell us of her struggles instead of illustrating them out with her language (ironically enough even the illustrations do little to add depth to each poem). It doesn't help that almost every poem sounds like another she's already written. (but Ayse, doesn't that show her strong voice? maybe if she tackled new concepts in an interesting way! Her poems all revolve around the same things: Depression, Anxiety, Assault, Sex, Being a Brown woman/daughter of immigrants and the strange intersection of misogyny and racism that comes with that identity, and of course, finding yourself. As a daughter of immigrants myself, I did feel a strong connection to her writing at first because it didn't feel like her experience, it felt like mine. However, now we're here 3 volumes later and I feel like I'm reading the same poems, with the same themes over and over again. I was tempted to go back through every volume of her poetry and organize sticky notes when a poem was eerily similar to another, but ultimately I decided my time was better spent doing other things. I felt like her writing is more appropriate for a personal essay. I say this not only because Kaur doesn't show us her experiences but tells them, but also because I feel like a longer form would allow her to explore these experiences and ideas more. I felt like each poem was lacking, missing some vital soul-searching/concept exploration. The poems felt half-formed and some like afterthoughts, lines I'd jot down in my phone's notes section while I wait for the bus or some shit like that.All in all, I'm leaving this volume of poetry disappointed and frustrated. I wanted more from this. ",2,default,[]

It oozes out blood when cut, breathes air into itself to nourish it's words and feeds on nutrition to ensure it grows in every sense of emotions and enroots itself deep into the psyche of it's reader. Reading this was eccentric, almost maddening me with ideas, with a tingling sensation all around my body, rushing like current. The feeling of being loved or the feeling of love. That eternal feeling of warmth and electricity flowing through the nerves of your body. These words have the force that ""texts"" cannot, cause you know who or what he or she is writing about and writing for. Thus even without a single drop of insult falling on the person, the work is done, the arrow is struck deep, into the heart’s core. People come, people go. Words are the only thing left behind, forever, unaffected by the storm of time. In any form, in mind, in writings but they remain. Those helpless creatures strike the hardest, tell you all of it, taking with them all of you.This is exactly the book we all needed this lockdown, this is the book that will define the pandemic for many. This will be the souvenir many of us will preserve for ages, to remind what a homebody the world became one doomed year.The poems are a testimony, it talks a lot about the author’s interest in humanity, in a very articulate and inspiring way. There’s a very pointed sense of astute, underbelly of personal attachment  inscribed into the lines, and the metaphors comes to us with much awe. Everything about this section of poems is raw, free and very original. Rupi Kaur's spare, illusive lines convey wry, sometimes playful, often sharp observations and warmth that poetry's magic has. The verses are brisk, the selection of words very crude and exemplary—and therefore the poetic touch is unique. These poems came with a vivid sense of sadness and retrospection, talking about common people with their habits, love and loss. In all, these poems to me, shined brighter than the many other poems this lockdown has made me read, some worst being my own creations. Many did question and still question Rupi Kaur's rise to fame, of how her poetry collections sell in millions while others often do not even hit proper market stands. What makes Kaur stand out amongst the sporadic rise of poets is her sense of realism and connectivity to the reader. As a young reader myself, everything, every inch, every punctuation mark was something I could directly relate with. One cannot deny but see how relevant Kaur's poetry is with today's happenings and of what the present generation is feeling. One cannot deny or oversee the depth of understanding she has of our feelings, our breakups, our abuse, our stifling of voices, our revolution, our depression, our resistance, our sense of belonging, our feeling of getting lost, our self love, our growth, our rise from the ashes. ""depression is silent you never hear it coming and suddenly it's the loudest voice in your head""My life is full of not-so-great things. I have a marvellous time in ruining everything. I am often found staring into emptiness, to the sea, to the sky, to the greenery anything that is empty with its beauty. But well, this is teenage. A venture into the eerie and perilous wilderness of adulthood, born out of the frustration of getting out from the safe bubble of childhood. What fuels this fire? Love. Feelings. Rush of chemicals. Sensations of burning. A cacophony of sounds. A shrill hum of ecstasy. A loud shout of help. A rush of heat all over the body. All of this? None of this? Who knows. What I know is being young is broken yet beautiful. Ecstatic yet chaotic. Painful yet full of joy. You demand to be set free, to make your own path but all you get is getting caught, clamped inside the chains of relations and expectations. This is being young. Who else could explain this better than one who has grown through it very recently as I am? Kaur's poetry strikes hard in the first two parts of the book: mind and heart. Mind talking about depression, the thousand forms of sadness that feed on the human body, the million tentacled of a demon monster feeding on the matter of the mind. Here is poetry so strong and so real, that after you are done, you stop and admire the intricate detailing with which Kaur has observed herself and our whole generation's commonality. Depression as Kaur explains through her esoteric poetic sense, is often born from a situation, a feeling, an emotion, more like a consequence to a trauma than to be the cause of it. Rupi Kaur explains with a sense of horror, a sense of destituted fracture about assault as a reason. She paints in a million colours, a thousand fractures and a hundred tears about how painful it is. For the sorority of survivors is not easy to handle, being a survivor and telling it all is even more. Hands of all those evils that you have conquered coming back is difficult, to relive my own memories through the prism of someone's else pain is almost breaking for me. Half of youth remains sober, whatever oxymoron it maybe, they wish to remain out of the powerful grasp of teenage. Is it good? Oh, hell no! How can a person be a person if he or she has never felt like a person? How can a human be a human without any humane emotions? How can you know what you will use a stone for, some for throwing or some for momg a diamond ring? How can one live outside life imagining to return to it once the actual chemical rush is over? Here is her next part that shines: heart. How can one not sense love or unlove inside here, inside these words? Homebody is an ode to modern love, contemporary complex love. She talks about love: the feeling of getting loved, the sensation of loving, the heat rising during intercourse, the burning desire of the heart, about unlove: the pain of an abusive relationship, the pangs of despair of a cheating partner, the grief of loosing love, the gloom of seeing your love going to waste and you withering away without it and about self love: about friends who actually care and stick by forever, masturbation and it's self pleasing satisfaction, the sensation of upliftment when one loves self in it's truest form.The other half of the youth is a broken mass. A youth made out of the broken rumbles of a fell down building made out of belief, love, and what not. We see hurt with our eyes, abide goodbye and smoke our way out. Yet however courageous we may act as, deep down all of us are equally decimated and broken. Inside every amigos of life, we sap out and tap in the juice of grief. Life throws us curve balls, we tackle them, grow out of it, yet we remain scarred from that for the whole life. It is these scars that we hail as prizes and make us beautiful. How can a warrior be devoid of scars? Japanese have an art form called Kintsugi, you join the broken pieces of an object using gold paint, telling you to bear your scars with pride, show them to the world. It tells you that everything is vulnerable. All it takes to thrive is a little hope inside that blinding darkness. Scars are beautiful, they tell your story, they tell you if the other one truly accepts your or not.""why does everything become less beautiful once it belongs to us""Here comes Rupi Kaur's penultimate offering: rest. The poems here are meant to instigate the fire of self love, to burn the flicker or ember of loving yourself more than you love anyone else. Here are poems that take of life, of its myriad race against time, of its farrago of competition and rush for living the dream, it's concoctions of differences and of experience. We are all born out of ashes. Our creation a testimony of the destruction that was in the prelude. We are all dust of the thousand stars that collide to form life. All combinations of a million atoms, of different proportions, of different combinations. We all are in a way, this or that, are special, that too in an wonderful way.Kaur ends her collection with awake, and the poems in here touched my soul and tendered it to a manganous extent. Human is to err in magnanimity, but here is poetry so flawless that it pierce the soul and retches it apart from the dark shambles of the messed up mind. Here is poetry that comes out of experience, out of real life experience, born out of life and it's err.It has another element that most poetry miss: relevancy. It cannot be overseen. Rupi Kaur talks about the recent events, about Black Lives Matter and about J K Rowling controversy. I do not know if she intends on it, but two poems marked major for me.I could not help but remember how Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie supported J K Rowling in her speech and then went on to talk about feminism. Kaur marks the difference here, that her ( Kaur's ) feminism has inclusivity and includes trans women in it. How can we not applaud her? How can we support person like Adichie who talks about being a feminist at the cost of trampling upon other communities? This is not feminism, this is sexism. ""in a world that doesn't consider my body to be mineself-pleasure is an act of self-preservation""We all Indians must have noticed this, when Kangana Ranaut, the queen of messed up minds, who feeds on wrong info, rude language and abusive behavior and rules over calling out people and starting controversies everywhere, commented on a person's post and wrote against masturbation. Well well, who cannot hold their laughter? Yes, I cannot. This too is not empowerment or being woke or feminism of any sorts, this is blatant sense of cloudiness. Kaur marks her stance clear over here and I cannot enough praising her for this. It talks about the immigrant experience, the experience of a life of a person of color in a country which is alien to them, about growing in a racist world. It takes about sexism, about the problems women have to face each day, about misorgyny and it's ways of getting on the mind, about capitalism and it's evil and greedy tentacles that blind you, about differences that cloud the lenses to make one even violent. ""when you're an immigrantyou keep your head down and stay working when you're a refugee andyou don't have paperswhen they call you illegaloutsiderterroristtowelheadyou work until your bones become dust you are the only one you can count on""It talks about how her poetry was born as a revolution, as a resistance, as a balm to her pains of the past. It shows how unfair and unjust and inhuman the Sikh Genocide of 1984 in India was, and how it broke many mentally and physically. She inspires here, gives us reasons to rise and grow, gives us motivation to be the best of self and love ourselves, tells us the forms in which we are beautiful, forms in which our voices matter, tells us how we too are an integral part of the universe. Homebody with its unique style of poetry, is a unique and deep effort on the part of the poet to convey, record and making us understand. Rupi Kaur's poetry is not wrought with emotions, not with heavy expression or deft use of verses or hyperbole. These poems are marked by disruptions in the verses, and express themselves through the disarray they portray with the help of a myriad of realism and humour. They move forward in lurches, in jolts and they seek to express through a close-knit, solid punch of underlined meanings, without devoting much time in elaboration. Here is poetry that adds a colourful fervor, lucious paints to the blank canvas of a variety of topics: ranging from politics to nature, from love to sadness, from motivation to self love. Rupi Kaur has let her poetic liberty flow like a gushing stream, and it has freely accumulated in puddles of deeper contextual understandings, reflecting from it's surface the sunlight and the prism of the colors of life. ",0,default,[]

You never hear it coming. And suddenly it's the loudest voice in your head."".[🌟🌟🌟🌟].I read Milk & Honey by Rupi Kaur when it came out couple years back and it took a while to get used to her writing style. It was something new and unique and it piqued my interest. After two books, this third installment talks about mental health, depression, assault, feminism and hope. .Starting this book, I knew what to expect writing style wise and that made the experience even more enjoyable for me. First, I loved the topic it started off with. Assault and depression are some things that are not talked about that commonly in India. Even when one is not at fault, (a child never is when assaulted) the ignorance usually allows people to be judgemental and it took courage to write about that. It talks about toxic relationships, lost innocence and suppressed voice. I loved the mood and the heavy emotion it set. It sucked me in and transported me to the place where I could think about the severity of the acts. .Second, I think the four sections the author divided this book into has a connection with respect to asking questions. 1. It starts with the How? when she described about her mind and the kind of struggle she had been dealing with for years. 2. It goes to the Why? When she explains herself and her situation better with the depression and the abusive relationship and the toxicity of it.3. It comes to the What? When she explains what needs to be done to empower oneself and fight against the How and the Why.4. And it finishes not with a question, but with a word. Hope. Talking about her family and their struggles and her lost time with friends gave so much hope to the questions that could be answered. .I am not much of a poetry reader unless it discusses something real, happening and that can hit me in my face. This book talks about female empowerment, inclusivity, feminism all without insinuating other's responsibility. She talked about how it's your own responsibility to get through dark times, tackle depression and taking care of yourself. I loved this book because it talked about all these topics. It talked openly about things we shy away from talking. Sex, depression, abuse, pleasure. I hope this book gives you the opportunity to think about all of them, contemplate your thoughts and mull over it, like it gave me. It's not my favorite by her, but I still liked the message it discussed!.My favourite lines from the book :.• ""I’m either romanticizing the past or i’m busy worrying about the future. It’s no wonder I don’t feel alive. I’m not living in the only moment that’s real""• ""If you’re waiting for them to make you feel like you’re enough, you’ll be waiting a long time""• ""We were always in survival mode long after we didn’t need to be""• ""I became confident once i decided that having fun was far more important than my fear of looking silly""• ""Isn’t it funny how you can occupy a space without being in touch with it""• ""Make it a point to love yourself as fiercely as you do other people"".Thank you Simon & Schuster India for the review copy, which lets me give you my unbiased opinion..Paperback/ Arc by Simon& Schuster/ December 2020",0,default,[]

Firstly, I love Rupi Kaur's books. Her words can pick me up on any given day. Reading her books makes me feel that my feelings have been given words and what better way to describe your feelings than by saying it in the form of Poetry. I was eagerly waiting for the release of her next book and I am so glad that I could pick it up this soon and talk about it here. The Book "" home body"" has been divided into four parts: mind, heart, rest, awake. I would just talk about the four parts in one or two lines:Mind:This segment of the book deals with all the conundrum that our mind makes us feel. The conflict between the mind and the heart and how sometimes our mind seems out of place or out of control of ourselves. Sometimes, it feels as if our mind and the rest of the body are two different beings. I am just sharing two of my favorite poems from this segment:"" I have never known anything more quietly loud than anxiety"""" i'm either romanticising the past or i'm busy worrying about the future it's no wonder  i don't feel alive i am not living  in the only moment that's real"" -present2) Heart This segment talks about the issues of our hearts. The expectation of our heart from a relationship, the trauma that our hearts suffer in the hands of people, how our heart tries to justify the worst of things when it comes to letting go of the people we feel we love, the love in the form of friends that we have, why self-love is one of the most important forms of love and how we should not burden relationships with too many expectations."" the love of family friends and community is just as potent as the love of a romantic relationship"""" its impossible  for one person to fill you up in all the ways you need to be filled your partner can't be your everything""3) Rest This segment talks about the importance of taking it slow at times; not to lose yourself in the race of being over productive, how accomplishment will not be worth it if there is no peace in your heart, and how the feeling of self-worth is more important than all the worldly achievements. ""you might have done the external work but your mind is starving for internal attention"" - listen"" we already have the things the can complete us they just aren't things they are people and laughter and connection"" - irreplaceable4) Awake This segment talks about the awakening of the heart, mind, and soul. The struggles that we go through is an important element that builds our character is an important part of the awakening of an individual. Awakening of mind is important to bring about important changes in society and this segment makes a strong emphasis on it. "" your voice is your sovereignty"" - free"" i'm not interested  in a feminism that thinks simply placing women at the top of oppressive system is progress"" - not your convenient figureheadI highly recommend this book. Rupi Kaur's book has always emphasized love, immigrants, trauma, feminism, migration, human rights, migration, community, and the feeling of oneness with your body, mind, and soul. Her words have the power to soothe you.",0,default,"['poetry', 'modern-poetry', 'hard-hitting-lines', 'quote-worthy']"

There were a few things that were off about this collection, one of the most notable being that Kaur seems to have a missed opportunity to include poems about the corona virus. Yes, touchy subject, but the title of the book almost demands it, I’m sure the book could’ve been put on the back burner for another year or so to include some of those themes. But that’s just a personal opinion, I didn’t actually dock it for that.Overall several of these poems are repeats from both Milk and Honey as well as from The Sun and Her Flowers. There was a natural progression from book one to book two, I feel, with Kaur writing about Islamaphobia, death, culture etc in her last book, which made sense considering Milk and Honey was published in a much different world than The Sun and Her Flowers. This book tried to keep up with the times, but a lot of the poems, as I said, feel like they repeated themselves from prior books and to some extent, from each other. I find that Kaur can do personal poems very well alongside more political poems pretty well, but this batch of poems just didn’t click for me. Her poems on migration, rape and trauma I feel are always the moments where she has me in my feelings but as I mentioned previously, while there was a natural progression in Kaur’s writing and themes from book 1 to book 2, this book’s progression would have to be that she isn’t censoring herself as much, going as far as to describe masturbation and even using the words “bullshit” and “pussy.” Don’t get me wrong, I loved this! It really does feel like growth for her, I just wish she would employ more of her personal experiences more often in this book rather than trying to reach out to the reader. There are touching poems here about her father, and some interesting moments where she discusses the pressure of writing for an audience, but these are only about a handful and they’re few and far between in a book that tries a bit harder to relate to every reader. The Sun and Her Flowers was my favorite book by her. I’m excited to see what else she does, but I do hope she tries something different. This book, with its repeats, felt rushed, clumsy and a buy in into the capitalism she herself, in this book, claims to hate. 2.5/5.",0,default,['poetry']

It's safe to say that her poetry collections don't even need a synopsis because they all tackle similar themes. Without beating around the bush, I'll just say: I am not a fan. I think after having read all her three collections that are out, it's very safe to say that. According to Buzzfeed News, ""Kaur’s poetry has been dubbed by the Huffington Post as essential reading for women everywhere due to her engagement with gendered yet universal themes such as sexism, abuse, trauma, sexual violence, and friendship. It’s this universality that can propel a poem — or part of it — into viral territory..."" I do not deny this. Her works have impacted so many women's lives, particularly South Asians, and has helped them fight tooth and nail for their individuality. Kaur digs nail-deep into very real, raw issues of womanhood (as mentioned by Buzzfeed News) and her readers feel an aching sense of connectivity with her words. In a nutshell, her fanbase is huge. My gripe isn't with the emotional impact of her poetry because there are some that genuinely have moved me to tears so many times. On top of that, I am someone who is a very emotionally-invested reader. However, it's the genre, the punctuations, the modern method, I don't mesh with. I just cannot wrap my head around how this classifies as poetry:""the way theyleavetells youeverything""My understanding of poetry is very binary. For me, it's rhyming otherwise my concept of poetry is floating in outer space, directionless and confused. This collection simply doesn't stand out. I feel like every poetry collection tackles the same issues and it ends up getting overly repetitive and banal. In Home Body, there's a sudden, unexpected shift to poems about productivity from self-love and abuse, and I failed to see how that connection was made. There was no rhyme or reason to this collection and everything felt disjointed, as though a pearl necklace had just been dropped and all the beads ran helter-skelter. Everything disintegrated. I wasn't as touched or wowed as I was when I read Milk and Honey. The marketing of this book is misleading. It's not poetry; it's a collection of some messy thoughts that are given a structure, a format, in this lethargic attempt at concocting yet another journal of poems that are no different from my musings in eighth grade: ""sometimesi love you meansi want to love you""1st read (and my last): June 3, 2021

Looking back on my reviews of her past books I thuoght that my favorite was her first, but it turns out it was dethroned by her latest release (the second book being the one I like the least). This collection of poetry touched me deeply and there is something raw and profound in the way Rupi portrays emotions. Rupi Kaur is the biggest and most important voice in contemporary poetry in vogue now. Her poetry is filled with layers of meaning and of pain, grief, struggle and rebirth. She brings the themes of feminism, immigration and displacement in her poetry and articulates them so well you are left with unease and unrest in your core. My favorite sections were ""mind"" and ""awake"" and I feel that with this collection Rupi has evolved so much, no only in her craft but also as a women, and this is transparent through her writing. This book marks a new era in her career and I can't wait to see what comes next. My favorite poem:i paid in blood to be here. i paid with a childhood littered with bigger monsters than you. i've been beaten into a silence more times than i've been embraced on this earth. you haven't seen what i've seen. my rock bottom went so deep i'm pretty sure it was hell. i spent a decade climbing out of it. my hands blistered. my feet swelled. my mind said i can't take it anymore. i told my mind you better get yourself together. we came here for joy. and we are going to feel all of it. i've been hunted. killed. and walked back to earth. i snapped the neck off every beast that thought it could. and you want to take my seat. the one i built with the story of my life. honey. you won't fit. i juggle clowns like you. i pick my teeth with fools like you for fun. i have played and slept and danced with bigger devils.

I feel like people either revere Rupi Kaur, lining their insta-stories with her quotes, or really just can’t stand her even in the slightest. I somehow seem to fall in between these two polarizing camps; I really liked Milk and Honey and did not really care for The Sun and Her Flowers. I would rank Home Body as falling squarely between her past two works, both in terms of quality and impact.“don’t sleep onthe doormat of your potentialwaiting for things to happenwhen you could be”This passage for example, is a rather basic sentiment that has been echoed many times before by many other voices, but the way Kaur frames it within her struggle of wanting to be productive, while fearing the failure of not meeting her first success, still made me feel like I could look at the words anew. Her denunciation of how capitalism has made people slaves of what they are able to accomplish, versus the inherent human worth of who people are was also further elevated the work.

She has a knack for verbalizing exactly what I have felt before in such a direct, efficient way which is something I can really appreciate. I think I wrote this before in my review for Milk and Honey but a lot of haters argue if her work is poetry or poetic written lines and I still don't feel like that's relevant. I think Rupi Kaur has a consistent way of writing that if you didn't like her work from her previous two books, maybe just don't pick this one up.3 stars because the beginning was phenomenal but by the end I felt worn out. She tackles what feels like every social issue in this collection and I hate to be the person that complains about that, but this is my Goodreads review so I can do whatever I want lmao. By the end, I was exhausted reading her poems which is not the greatest feeling for a reader to have.I will always commend any artist when they are vulnerable with an enormous public audience so here's a round of applause to Rupi Kaur for being bold enough to use her voice authentically and courageously. If you wanted to read this in one sitting, you probably could. The poems are mostly really short and digestible (in terms of vocabulary usage, not content as much). I probably won't run to the library next time she releases a collection, but I'll definitely read it--more out of curiosity than anything else.",0,default,[]

It was a few years ago when I got the book and needless to say, I flew through it. So this week, when I got my hands on HOME BODY it was a similar, if not a more profound experience..Using a very simple yet nuanced language, Kaur is able to dive into the depths of the readers' hearts and leaves it bare. The topics covered were ones that plague the modern man today - in various degrees of course - looking after oneself, loving oneself, mental health; apart from new topics such as familial roots and most importantly, of the need of productivity that claws at our minds today..As a person who always tries to be productive, those were the pieces that struck me the most. These days as I grapple with my self worth in the face of covid induced restlessness, lesser concentration span, my reading slumps, and an overall increase in a feeling of hopelessness, these poems struck me because I had come to devalue myself - to find myself unworthy because I was not working, not being productive! And I suppose these were also the poems that touched so many others..Rupi Kaur's poetry continues to sustain me, to uplift me and to push me to accept myself as I am, just as I move towards self actualization. If you are looking for something like that, I recommend you to definitely pick it up!.Thanks to @simonandschusterin for sending me a review copy of this book!",0,default,['modern-poetry']

The topics might differ a bit - this collection definitely focuses on things that I don't think were as prominent in her other ones, from what I remember - but it's very much as if I'm being told quite similar things. And I don't judge her for that. As writers you tend to have certain things you will return to in your body of work, and it has obviously worked out very well for Kaur. I guess at this point I'm just not as affected by it like I was when I was 20 when I read her first collection. Well, why do you keep picking up her books, you might ask. I honestly hadn't planned to, but this was a gift and I'm going to honor that gift. And I don't regret reading it. Not at all. Many things still resonated with me, only I'm not as into the way they're written anymore. But I respect how she talks about trauma and inclusion and that she doesn't really hold back. You have to admire that courage, especially since women - in particular women of color - constantly get told to be quiet. So Rupi Kaur can write whatever she wants as long as it's healing and empowering for her. All the more respect to her and what she's built.",0,default,"['read-in-2020', 'poetry']"

Like its predecessor, I did enjoy portions of this collection very much, and I didn’t find any of it bad per se; it just was not as original or moving overall as I would have liked. Again, this collection felt very inspired by Kaur’s experiences, and it’s wonderful that she is sharing her story, but very little of it felt unique or fresh. I realize that it’s impossible not to be inspired by other writers, but I also believe that great writers are able to make something truly their own. There were some good pieces here, but most of it felt like it wasn’t going far enough. It felt as if the collection was written for younger readers, teens or maybe early twenties, as the writing was quite simplistic and lacking the depth it could have had given the themes. The writing is just too general. I’m not surprised that so many people relate to it because there are not many people who couldn’t with how general it is. Also, like the previous collection, I’m not a fan of the all lowercase and lack of punctuation. Like her previous collection, I’d recommend this to fans of Kaur’s work and younger readers, but I think there are much better collections out there that are getting way less buzz.

BUT home body was not a hit for me. i think i liked maybe 1 poem? the rest were just there. i see what this book wants to do and i support it, but it didn't work for me. the best section of the book (there are 4) was probably rest, which discusses themes of work, procrastination and capitalism, as well as taking a break from said work. the beginning section - mind - was the darkest of all, exploring her trauma and mental illnesses. the last section was the one where i was most confusion. 'awake' is about race, feminism, and loving yourself. it honestly felt like half of the poems could be from motivational posters, which is cool, except it meant they were like two sentences long and not much like a poem. to end this off, no, i did not ""not like"" this book, but giving it 2 stars feels like too much given i will never read this again and that the poems were not that good. i cannot stress how much this is my own opinion, and that the author is free to write however many poems, no matter how bad/mediocre, if this helps her deal with things. ok byetw//child molestation, rape, physical and emotional abuse",0,default,['poetryyy']

Kaur successfully takes you through the concepts of depression, anxiety, acceptance, toxic relationship, self-worth, friendship, productivity anxiety, gratitude and responsibilities towards parents.You will see a confident, less vulnerable narrator. The newer protagonist in the book is more practical than emotional. Kaur is much more evolved and socially responsible. She talks about serious issues like nature, environment, sustainability, commercialized self-help, self-care, work-life balance, being content etc. The boldest parts of the book for me are where she talks about Sikh genocide, racism, sexism, misogyny. She very bravely challenges the so-called concept of feminism. ""Sometimes I love you means I want to love you.Sometimes I love you meansI’ll stay a little while longer.Sometimes I love you means I’m not sure how to leave.Sometimes I love you means I have nowhere else to go.""I 100% recommend this book.",0,default,[]

This isn't to say that I don't appreciate the talent that Rupi Kaur undoubtedly has - typically I enjoy around half of the poems within a collection she puts out into the world. But this time I really struggled to resonate with even one of them (actually, I think there was exactly one that hit home for me). I think poetry is incredibly personal, and I think perhaps the trap I am falling into when choosing poetry anthologies is selecting a poet who I have previously enjoyed work from and not necessarily checking what they are hoping to write about. In reality, the topic covered is more important and Home Body was a collection filled with poignant poems, particularly surrounding immigration and racism, but I felt a little on the outside of this topic rather than it provoking a strong personal emotion from me. Part of the problem there also lies with how short a lot of these poems were - it's not possible to get lost in her talent or beautiful prose, which may usually cause you to enjoy a poem when the message doesn't necessarily have impact for you personally, because these poems are just too small. Most often each poem was two lines, or three at best, and this means if the message isn't there then it's suddenly very tricky to forge a path to enjoying it.This is definitely a case of, ""it's not you, it's me"", but I would be remiss to increase my rating purely because I know someone else will find this book to be perfect, when I just didn't.

It serves as an introduction to poetry for a lot of people and in her first two books she highlights important issues & shows a lot of vulnerability. While I have never considered anything she had written particularly profound, I moderately enjoyed her first two books. She also is just such a kind and approachable person which probably made me enjoy her books more. This book was just extremely underwhelming. There is no depth. She glosses over tops with one sentence poems. For example, “I am not interested in a feminism that excludes trans women.” Great! But is that really all you have to say ???? she readdressed many of the same topics she’s has in the past but did not really say anything new. I wish she would write more long(er) pieces! A lifetime on the road was by far the most memorable poem. The willingness to broach taboo subjects did not feel vulnerable in this book because it felt like she took herself out of the pieces all together. It almost seemed like she was just copy writing.

I also realized while reading that this book feels incredibly similar to her second novel, which also felt incredibly similar to her first novel; The way I see it, Kaur hasn't really written three books, she's written the same book three times, each one discussing the same topics in the same lukewarm approach. Most of the poems here are more effective as affirmations or advice, specifically targeting young women, which is ironic because Kaur wrote a poem in here about how she's sick of ""commercialized self-help"" products.",0,default,[]

This is her latest collection (and also one that I hadn't read yet), and it was an experience from to beginning to end. This was the one, out of all three, that I could relate to the most. Almost every poem evoked something within me, particularly the ones about mental health, capitalism and feminism/misogyny. Kaur also writes about the pressures of productivity, and how she feels like she has to release a new collection of poetry consistently even if it is sub-par. This is something I'm sure most people can relate to, especially those in the arts sector. This collection is definitely a lot darker compared to her two previous works; you can feel Kaur's anger flowing out of the pages. Would 100% recommend. ",0,default,"['5-star-reads', 'poetry']"

I agree with Rupi, I think that women must free themselves from the chains that have tamed us through time and that racism must end.Nevertheless, I don't like her books:1 - I think that everyone with common sense could have written these books. They are modern ""poetry"", but for me they are simply random texts that sometimes do not even make any sense.2 - I think that the author takes advantage of ""hot topics"" and writes whatever she thinks that people want to hear. However, I know that as an immigrant she must have struggled a lot. 3 - I don't know, I find this book (as well as the others) very poor and without content. Her books are only pretty and aesthetic.

Some poems make you admire the sheer magical skills of creating a beautiful string of sounds and pictures and others, like Rupi's, are soothing in their clear simplicity.

It's so personal and small but can also shake you to your core. I really loved this. Rupi Kaur is the master of writing three lines that make me sit back and evaluate my human essence, haha. I get that this style of poetry writing isn't for everyone, but it is very disheartening to see people put it down as lesser than more traditional forms of poetry or longer poems. I like to think of poetry as an extension of the mind and the self. This means that sometimes all you are is a simple line of truth, and that is beautiful and valid. All of that being said, I feel kind of weird rating this since her work is such a personal experience for me.

Joseph Campbell might say that the hero's quest was survived. Much less raw than her previous collections, Kaur's poetry reminds us that (self-)care is at the centre of renovating, restoring and maintaining a home: our bodies.

Is Rupi Kaur's poetry structurally mediocre? Yeah, it's not exactly a complicated sonnet with multiple layers of depth in its metre. But, it's hard to deny that Kaur's poetry aptly illustrates and comments on hard-hitting experiences that many, MANY women face. There's no better feeling or validation than seeing one's intense and often abstract emotions being neatly and concisely laid out on a page through words and pictures. And, the universality of the themes she explores and normalizes is sure to make a monumental impact on many Gen Z and Millenial women facing humongous transitional periods in their lives. The simplicity of her poetry does not negate its value.

The Written Review
ah. ifinally understand.it's not the wordsthat matter,but the spacesbetween.
-a slightly sarcastic review - 
I'm not normally a poetry person and this book did nothing to convince me otherwise.This whole book felt like those instagram quotes minus the inspirational photograph. Does that even count? I admit I'm no expert, but the words seemed more poetical than poem. Like the author took a really pretty sentence and then hit enter a lot.Also, maybe I'm a hypocrite here (just based on the sheer amount of books in my house) but I kind of felt bad for all the unused page space in this book. There's barely a handful of words per page and just vast amounts of white paper. It just felt a bit wasteful.Overall - it was...an experience. Not the best experience, but an experience nonetheless.

The concepts in this poem, especially when it rolled around to the feminism aspects, just didn't wow me. An entire poem just about ""you don't NEED a man you WANT a man"" was just a repeat of things I've been hearing for years.

Rupi Kaur really touched me deeply with this incredibly work of art. Her words of truth and honesty are so powerful and so full of emotion, I can't imagine anyone's eyes staying dry while reading it.A few times, though, I was a little confused, I couldn't comprehend the meaning of her words. The again came a poem about independence, how she was healing from her boyfriend's loss, closely followed by one that showed her hopeless and lost once again.Anyway, this was so much more complex than The Princess Saves Herself in this One, but however different these two books are, they both have their own power and strength.Here is one more poem taken from Milk and Honey that I can't stop thinking about:“i want to apologize to all the women i have called pretty before i’ve called them intelligent or brave i am sorry i made it sound as though something as simple as what you’re born with is the most you have to be proud of when your spirit has crushed mountains from now on i will say things like you are resilient or you are extraordinary not because i don’t think you’re pretty but because you are so much more than that”Find more of my books on Instagram",266,default,"['important', 'to-buy']"

Milk and Honey is pretty much a dream come true for emo fourteen-year-old girls who spend their spare time browsing deep, meaningful quotes written in pretty fonts like this one:Also: I am going to argue that this is not poetry. Poetry is Robert Frost and Edgar Allan Poe and Emily Dickinson. I know poetry covers a wide range of styles, and I'm not saying free verse isn't poetry. I've read some excellent books by Ellen Hopkins written in free verse, expressing the lives of troubled teens better than most authors could. The writing in this book is barely even free verse. It's a collection of short sentences, words really, broken into segments.i could writea sentencein small-capsand keep hitting enterso it looks coolbut that does not make it poetryIt really concerns me that this is a New York Times bestseller. Is this what people think of poetry nowadays? Granted, Milk and Honey did tackle a lot of tough subjects like abuse, heartbreak, and self-healing, but the poor quality of writing distracted from the message.Some of the verses were outright laughable:
when i am sadi don’t cry i pourwhen i am happyi don’t smile i glowwhen i am angryi don’t yell i burn
And this one is just too good:
the goddess between your legsmakes mouths water
Did you really just call women's reproductive organs a ""goddess""? I'm still cracking up.Also, why is this book so against women shaving? It acts like men hate hairy women but do you really think the average man sits around thinking, ""I would totally date her, but she has leg hair."" And don't feed me that ""beauty standards are oppressing women"" lie. No one is forcing women to go to the store, buy a razor, and shave. I shave because I like my legs to feel smooth. If you feel like your body hair empowers you, go you. If you feel like smooth skin empowers you, go you. I don't want to hear about it either way.The truly sad thing about Milk and Honey is the author actually made some good points. Take this verse about women putting other women down:
other women’s bodiesare not our battleground
This is a serious issue that could have inspired a beautiful poem with a powerful message, but instead, the author wrote two lines that once again made me feel like I was browsing a teen girl's tumblr page.

Milk and Honey
 is about happiness and despair, hurt and joy, love and sadness, and finding the strength to overcome your struggles. It is at times erotic, poignant, empowering, harrowing, and a celebration of all of the amazing qualities of women. Divided into four chapters—the hurting, the loving, the breaking, and the healing—each deals with a different step in relationships, both with someone else and with yourself.most importantly lovelike it's the only thing you know howat the end of the day all thismeans nothingthis pagewhere you're sittingyour degreeyour jobthe moneynothing even mattersexcept love and human connectionwho you lovedand how deeply you loved themhow you touched the people around youand how much you gave themSome of the poems are accompanied by small illustrations. I'd imagine that the print version of this book would make a beautiful gift for someone; I'm not sure if I missed out on something reading it on my Kindle, because I'm not 100 percent sure if each separate page is a separate poem or if the book is just laid out strangely. (I am also not quite sure if only some of the poems have titles or if each poem has its title at the end, meaning the stanzas between titled pages represent one poem.)Kaur is an absolutely dazzling writer. Her words evoke emotion, sexuality, femininity, anger, and hope. While perhaps some of this resonates more for women than for men, I still found this incredibly touching, incredibly moving, incredibly motivating, and at times simply breathtaking.you might not have been my first lovebut you were the love that madeall the other lovesirrelevantThis collection won't be for everyone. You need to be willing to put aside conventional notions of punctuation, capitalization, and the way sentences are divided. But more than that, you need to be willing to be vulnerable, to listen to Kaur's messages, and feel the feelings she is trying to convey.

Not that hard since the book is quite short and has lot of drawings, but still. I was surprised!Milk and honey may be poetry (for the most part), but it tells a very cohesive story. A very powerful and moving story too. It is ultimately a book about hardships and empowerment and in my humble opinion, although obviously directed towards women, the message of self loving can apply to anyone, woman or man.The drawings were simple and gorgeous. Actually, the book felt a lot like going through a writer's Instagram feed if that makes any sense.

love is not cruel we are cruellove is not a gamewe have made a gameout of love
 I can't believe it took me so long to finally read this poetry collection, after shivering over so much of Rupi's online poetry snippets over the years, but here we are, and it was... captivating? Painful? Beautiful? Perfect?
what i miss most is how you loved me. but what i didn't know was how you loved me had so much to do with the person i was. it was a reflection of everything i gave to you.how cruel i was to myself. giving you credit for my warmth simply because you had felt it.
I feel that this is a poetry collection that will be different things for different people, but for me, it was a love story written for those of us who have survived abusive relationships, who have moved on and learned to love ourselves despite the lies we were fed. If you've ever left a toxic relationship, friendship, situation, whatever - do you remember the first time you realized things weren't your fault? How it felt like the first breath of air after far too long underwater? That's what this collection felt like for me. It reminded me of how far I've come, and how strong I really am.

Even better, this collection is so shamelessly, wholly feminist in nature and I cannot imagine not feeling empowered by the words Rupi writes. She is so proud of her womanhood and it's a contagious feeling.

Actually, that's a lie. I know exactly how to review this book. I'm just not sure why I read it in the first place.There's a lot of hype surrounding this book, namely that it's feminist, eye-opening, beautiful, amazing, emotional, and meaningful. And while I'm sure that's exactly what some may have felt while reading this, I was widely annoyed and trying to figure out why I was wasting an hour of my life I would never be getting back.I probably should never have read this book in the first place. There are two reasons why:1. I hate poetry. I always have, and I know that part of it is because the only exposure I've had to poetry is either in school, where we had to read, annotate, and think about the hIdDeN mEaNiNgS for days on end, or the depressed Tumblr kind.2. I hate honey. I mean, it's in the title. It was basically a giant red flag I Naruto ran towards at high speed.Not to mention all the bad things I had heard about this book, in general, which was probably why I was so drawn to it in the first place, but yeah. The odds were basically stacked against this book, and things ended up exactly how I had expected them to be.I actually started out by listening to this, but not even three minutes in, decided that I also needed the visual copy to understand what the fook was being said. The audiobook was narrated by Rupi Kaur herself, and while I didn't particularly hate her style of narration, there is something to be said about her dramatic inflection which had me cringing at my screen at times. (At this point, I'm starting to think that I should probably just be grateful that the narrator had a voice that wasn't the auditory embodiment of ""dead inside"", but in all honesty, I didn't sign up for a soap opera either, now did I?)*ahem* Moving on.Now, the fact of the matter is that 90% of these poems read like depressed Tumblr egirl poems, namely:or something of the like. I'm sorry, but it is very difficult to take you seriously if a) none of your poems make sense, because of how filled they are with pretentious writing and white space, and b) you sound like you spend your time on r/poems. (No shade if you like to spend your time typing poems over noir backgrounds of rain on windows, because to each their own, I suppose.)Honestly though?These poems seemed more like something the author wrote in her spare time, as a form of self-therapy, or something. And then, to be able to publish them, a bunch of 'feminist' stuff was crammed in at the very end. Which, by the way, did not feel, at all, like the author had learned because of her experiences and what she had detailed in the previous sections, but more to be able to sell something.So yeah. I wasted part of my life reading a book I knew I wouldn't enjoy because I'm weird like that. Nothing else is new.

The book is divided into four chapters, and each chapter serves a different purpose. Deals with a different pain. Heals a different heartache. Milk and Honey takes readers through a journey of the most bitter moments in life and finds sweetness in them because there is sweetness everywhere if you are just willing to look. The first chapter, ""The Hurting"" is about the author's experience and struggles of family issues. The next chapter, ""The Loving"", has a more positive feeling. The poems have been described as sweet, and they are supposed to remind couples of the good things in a relationship. ""The Breaking"" brings the reader back to a dark place in the author's life. These realistic poems relate to the sad feeling after a breakup. The last chapter, ""The Healing"" tries to comfort and show women that they should embrace who they are and that they are valuable, no matter what they had to endure.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز نهم ماه اکتبر سال 2018 میلادیعنوان: شیر و عسل؛ نویسنده: روپی (روبی) کائور (کور)؛ مترجم: سمانه پرهیزکاری؛ تهران: انتشارات میلکان‏‫، 1396؛ در 192ص؛ شابک 9786008812067؛ موضوع شعر - زنان - نویسندگان هندی تبار کانادایی - سده 21م‬عنوان: شیر و عسل؛ نویسنده: روپی کائور؛ برگردان: مریم صفرزاده؛ تهران: واژتاب‏‫‬، 1397؛ در 78ص؛ شابک 9786229513828؛عنوان: شیر و عسل؛ اثر: روپی کائور؛ مترجم: فهیمه گدازچیان؛ تهران: دیبای دانش‏‫‬، 1397؛ در 103ص؛ شابک: 9786229919613؛‬روبی کور (روپی کائور)، نویسنده، و تصویرگر هندی تبار کانادایی هستند؛ نخستین کتاب ایشان، مجموعه‌ ای از شعر و نثر با عنوان: «شیر و عسل»، در سال 2014میلادی منتشر شد؛ کتاب دوم ایشان: «خورشید و گل‌هایش» نیز، در سال 2017میلادی منتشر شد؛ هر دوی این کتاب‌ها حاوی تصاویری هستند، که توسط «روبی کور» و دیگران، ترسیم شده‌ اند، تا به خوانشگر یاری نمایند یک تصویر را با هر شعر مرتبط سازد""بن که روی صندلی پشتی ماشین مچاله شده بود گفت: «اما مادربزرگ حوصله آدم رو سر میبره.» عصر جمعه یک روز سرد نوامبر بود و می‌رفتند طرف خانه مادربزرگش. قرار بود بن باز هم آخر هفته‌اش را آنجا بگذراند. دوباره نق زد: «اصلا همه پیرها حوصله سر برن.» پدر که ماشین کوچک و قهوه‌ای را می‌راند و شکم‌گنده‌اش به فرمان چسبیده بود گفت: «در مورد مادربزرگت این طوری حرف نزن.» - تنهایی اون جا حوصله‌ام سر میره! تلویزیونش خرابه و همیشه هم می خواد اسکربل بازی کنه. خونه ش هم همیشه بوی گند کلم میده!» مادر گفت: «خب بچه این یکیو راست میگه! لباسش همیشه بوی گند کلم میده.»...""تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 30/03/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",93,default,"['21th-century', 'non-fiction', 'poetry', 'feminism', 'canadian', 'literature']"

Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || Pinterest***UNPOPULAR OPINION TIME LOL*** I'm honestly surprised by how popular this book is because not only is it over-hyped, it's just not a very good book at all, in my opinion. The poetry is so cloying and pretentious - just enough ""unique"" enough to be ""special"" but vague enough to be relatable. If I had to describe the style, I'd say it's a cross between fortune cookie messages & those weird 3AM posts that one weird friend you have on Facebook loves to post that are always a) calling someone out, b) posting about personal drama, or c) writing weird inspirational stuff inspired by their mood board on Pinterest.(YOU KNOW WHICH FRIEND I'M TALKING ABOUT. WE ALL HAVE THAT WEIRD 3AM POST FRIEND.)THE PRINCESS SAVES HERSELF IN THIS ONE is written in a very similar style to this, and I reluctantly gave that book 3 stars because it felt genuine, and maybe even authentic, even if it was written in a style that I didn't like and felt juvenile. MILK AND HONEY, I'm sure, comes from authentic emotions and experiences as well, and while I can appreciate someone wanting to share those experiences and use poetry to heal, I, as a reader, am in no way obligated to like said poetry just because the intent behind it was important. If ""intent"" was enough to get five stars, the star rating system would be pointless, because I'm pretty sure most writers publish their books with the intent of success and acclaim.MILK AND HONEY comes across as pretentious and unpolished - a dichotomy that should not be possible, and yet, in MILK AND HONEY, it is. The book also features some incredibly gross metaphors like ""the goddess between your legs / makes mouths water"" and ""the very thought of you / has my legs spread apart / like an easel with a canvas / begging for art."" Ughhhh, noooo. I can only imagine that the popularity from this poetry comes from accessibility and the format that seems so easy to copy that any young aspiring poet probably takes one look and goes, ""oh, if this dreck can be published, maybe my dreck can be published, too!"" The drawings are no better, ugly even, and look like napkin scribbles rather than actual art.I didn't like this at all. Everything in it has been said before. I could write a longer review ranting more about taste, expectations, and Shel Silverstein, but I'm trying to cut back on swearing and brusqueness in reviews, so I don't think any more negativity is necessary. This author apparently has a pretty devoted following on social media, so I guess if you're into Tumblr feminism and line-break poetry (which seems to be the new trend), you'll probably enjoy this.1 to 1.5 stars",89,default,['poetry']

maybe i will just neverunderstand poetry unlessit is written in longer phrases and verses one brief line is neverenough for meno matter how muchi respect the ideas
Really, though, I have no idea how I felt about this. Milk and Honey is a collection full of emotion and meaning, but all the poems felt, to me, like unfinished pieces. Each little section of words could have been an amazing, cathartic experience... and yet, it just didn't go to that place for me. My favorite poems were the extended ones. For example, the poem on pages 140-141 was absolutely fantastic. I could read it over and over again. The rest, though? Nope. One good note, though: section four, the healing, was by far my favorite. I enjoyed section one as well, though it got repetitive. Two and three were worse, though; repeating the same words on love over and over got old fast.
neither of us is happybut neither of us wants to leaveso we keep breaking each otherand calling it love
Perhaps the unfinished nature of the poems is the point. Maybe Rupi Kaur wanted them to feel missing, to feel unfinished; they're all just little phrases and verses of her life. But it didn't work for me. I craved more out of these little poems and this little book.
i will not have youbuild me into your lifewhen what i want is tobuild a life with you
I also think it's fair to point out the accusations of plagiarism placed on Kaur in the Here are some sources on the matter that I think are relevant. Honestly, I don't see the poetry her as being that similar to Nayyirah Waheed's, and that a lot of the concerns are simply about the fact that Kaur is bestselling while other poets are not, which isn't something she, personally, can control. I'd like to bring it to people's minds, but I don't particularly think any of this is direct plagiarism. If I'm missing something, please let me know.

1. the saddening
I had high hopes. As with other few works, again, the title wasn’t tempting at all but still, after reading two poems, I thought it could work. It turns out I liked those two poems and maybe two more and that was it. High hopes...i had high hopesbut now they’re fallingstill fallingthrough an abysssoon enoughyou’ll hear the thud.I just wrote that and it could easily be poetry. Because that’s what some like-minded people will find in this book: barely poetic clichés, some drawings and prose. It definitely brought some bad Lang Leav’s memories to mind, but the main difference is that this book covers some themes that are usually difficult to discuss. Fortunately, feminism has opened a door and it allowed more and more women to express themselves. However, I was left with the impression that whereas passion was there, the writing seemed slightly lackluster in comparison to other lyrical works I’ve read. All right, I’m prevaricating – the writing just wasn’t good. In other words, we have emotion but a very poor execution. my heart woke me crying last night how can i help i begged my heart said write the bookFrom that moment, I had a bad feeling. It’s a touching statement that oozes authenticity; an understandable need, a clearly unfeigned emotion: to empty your mind (heart, as Kaur says) and write. But that poetic introduction was written in such a trite, forgettable way that I took it as the first warning. My intuition wasn’t mistaken; again. Milk and honey was not for me. I felt like I had to find out more about the writer. In the end, reading about her life was more interesting to me than this collection.love is not cruel we are cruel love is not a game we have made a game out of love*he isn’t coming backwhispered my head he has to sobbed my heart - wiltingThey take your breath away, don’t they?The book is divided into four chapters: ""the hurting"", ""the loving"", ""the breaking"" and ""the healing"". It deals with themes not easy to approach: violence, rape, family issues, loss. I appreciate Kaur’s courage when discussing so openly the complexity of such topics, but talking about painful situations no woman would like to experience in her life and adding breaksto overused sentencesisn’t exactly poetry, in my humbleopinion.This is a book about survival, but that alone can’t turn this into poetic writing.i’ve had sex she said but i don’t know what making love feels likeThese kinds of poems carry some depth, but the language is utterly uninspiring. I don't expect Proustian sophistication, but simplicity has been taken too literally. The poem I quoted above is an entire page. If I’m going to read such verse, it’d better be as gorgeous and meaningful as Alejandra Pizarnik or Juan Gelman’s poetry, for instance, people who used the same minimalist technique. One thing is to discuss certain themes using a straightforward, unadorned verse whose austerity perhaps tries to reinforce their genuine, raw nature. This is not the case, especially when one reads ""the loving"" section: honeyed lines that somehow reached a new level of insipidity but could still put the life of a diabetic at risk.Not everything is poetry, there are pages in prose that were rather painful to finish. Suddenly I was longing for more 4-line hackneyed gems.
2. the encouraging
Now, there’s an interesting thing in a poem like... don’t mistake salt for sugar if he wants to be with you he will it’s that simple...which can be found in ""the breaking"" - an inconsistent chapter but passable considering the rest. As I keep saying, the writing is not great but the last four lines explain the very essence of relationships. I’m a big fan of the “don’t waste time” philosophy; if people want to be with you, they will. The rest are ordinary excuses. That might be the strength of this book and the reason for the connection many have felt: it may help empower girls and women. I didn’t find many poems capable of doing that but that’s my experience. I would still encourage people to read this, especially women, if only to help them gain confidence to speak their minds, draw the line, claim their rights. Women's empowerment can come from the most diverse sources. Kaur's feminist views are much needed.Amidst the repetitive nature of several poems, I also found a passage worth reading. The emotional depth, the clarity with which Kaur dissected that confusing aspect of our humanity was reflected in very intimate and heartfelt paragraphs (with its ebbs and flows).
(view spoiler)[i will tell you about selfish people. even when they know they will hurt you they walk into your life to taste you because you are the type of being they don’t want to miss out on. you are too much shine to not be felt. so when they have gotten a good look at everything you have to offer. when they have taken your skin your hair your secrets with them. when they realize how real this is. how much of a storm you are and it hits them. that is when the cowardice sets in. that is when the person you thought they were is replaced by the sad reality of what they are. […]the idea that they were so engulfed by your existence they had to risk breaking it for the sake of knowing they weren’t the one missing out. your existence meant that little next to their curiosity of you. that is the thing about selfish people. they gamble entire beings. entire souls to please their own. one second they are holding you like the world in their lap and the next they have belittled you to a mere picture. a moment. something of the past. one second. they swallow you up and whisper they want to spend the rest of their life with you. but the moment they sense fear. they are already halfway out the door. without having the nerve to let you go with grace. as if the human heart means that little to them. [...] (hide spoiler)]
After that passage, there’s a list with 16 tips to get over someone. Stereotypes like crying, eating ice cream and starting new projects were also included. My connection went to hell after that. The transient state of things.you might not have been my first love but you were the love that made all the other loves irrelevantHaving read many poets – women and men – from different backgrounds and periods in world history, I’m afraid I can’t call this poetry.

Thus, I was looking forward to ending the year on a positive note with Milk and Honey by Rupi Kaur, a collection that has gotten positive feedback from many goodreads' users. Unfortunately, I was let down and find myself looking forward to quality poetry collections to read next year. Just because this collection was not necessarily geared toward me, I did glean some positives from my reading experience.-Kaur urges women to treat their bodies like a temple. She explains what she views as the difference between sexual abuse, rape, not consensual sex, and actually making love. I view this as important for younger readers as they are learning to discover their bodies, especially if they are in a difficult situation in terms of be ready or not to have sexual relations with a boyfriend. Kaur's words might not be geared toward me, but I could see where a teenager could benefit from them.-For those who do not find the words powerful enough, or in my case, unpolished writing, each page is accompanied by a picture. I am not a fan of graphic novels, liking to leave things to my over reactive imagination. Yet, just as Kaur's words are not necessarily geared toward me, these sketches depicting lovers at various stages of their relationships are not geared toward me either. They do help express her feelings of love and grief, especially to those readers who are moved by this poetry, and by default enhance her writing.-Throughout this raunchy collection, Kaur points out that as a woman of color that she must take ownership of her body. She says she is everyone who has come before her in her culture and she should be proud of this. This is important for all women, not just women of color, and she points out that women's natural body occurrences are still considered taboo by society as a whole and should be celebrated, not made to seem dirty or impure or embarrassed by them. Again, this is most likely geared toward young adult readers and I hope that they glean much from this message.-Finally, Kaur tells women and girls to take care of themselves, to treat themselves once in a while, to make them feel good about themselves. Whether this is in the form of ice cream, new bed sheets, or singing loudly in one's home, all these ways of self pampering go a long way toward boosting one's self esteem.Even though the writing in Milk and Honey was not written with my age bracket in mind, I took a lot from this poetry collection. My main drawback was the unpolished work that was self published in many editions as well as the sketches that accompanied this basic work. Perhaps, Kaur's next work will be more mature in language usage and sentence structure. She has a powerful message to tell to teenaged girls and it would be a shame if her poetry remained largely raw and unpolished in the future. I look forward to seeing if she matures as a writer.2 stars",82,default,"['feminism', 'poetry']"

What an amazing sad little book.Milk and honey is a collection of poems about different subjects. The author zooms in on love, in particular, heartbreak, for most of the book, but other subjects, such as abuse and femininity, are also discussed. Rupi Kaur can write poetry like no other. She makes everything personal and sad and her words are for her. I notice her anger, her dissatisfaction, but most of all, her love. Her prose is addictive and so well-thought.  ""You have sadness living in places sadness shouldn't live."" The story was not different than other poetry novels, but due to being so relating to my personal life, I was hooked. A lot situations reminded me of certain moments, feelings, in my life and I think a lot of readers experienced this. That made this novel very easy to read and very emotional. ""Sometimes I stay up thinking of all the places you are hurting which you'll never care to mention. I come from the same aching blood.

My mom is a free verse poet that has been recognized internationally. She usually has me read her work before she posts it and we read the work of other poets together all the time. So I know what I'm talking about when I say that judging poetry is a tricky business, but honestly, this just wasn't anything special. It felt less like I was reading poetry and more like I was reading the notes app on her phone. I've heard the sentiment that was repeated over and over again a million times before this, so honestly, this had nothing to say to me that I didn't already know. If this is the first work of poetry someone has read, I can understand it being their favorite, and I do appreciate Kaur for pouring her heart and soul into this, but for me, it just did absolutely nothing.The majority of the book is one sentence long and is just a paraphrase of all the previous poems. They almost exclusively have to do with sex, which is fine, but when a book is presented to me as a collection about love and family and independence, I don't know, I expect more platonic or familial love than the 2, maybe 3 poems I got, especially when the vast majority are about how sexy some guy is. The first section was promising, but then it sort of devolved from there.And the ""loving"" section greatly confused and concerned me, especially that last poem. Am I supposed to see the whole ""making up"" thing as romantic? Because it made me want to call the police. Maybe it's a precursor for ""breaking"", but then why wasn't it in that section instead, when it so obviously belonged there?

This is new territory for me and perhaps I should have begun with the classics and eased my way into a collection like this. Nonetheless, I do think my unpopular opinion of this book would have remained unchanged. I know that 2 stars on goodreads has slight negative connotation but in all honesty, I do think that, for a debut collection, this was ""okay"". So let me get my criticisms out of the way. Out of some 194 pages, I bookmarked 12 that stood out to me. There's no denying that there are some beautifully arranged words in this collection, but a lot of the time, that's all it appeared to be - a few arranged words on a page. Too many of the poems in this collection have twenty words or less and, this is just my preference, but I like to read a poem that has depth and divulges something about the author or myself - not 10 words that sound like a statement or a summary of a text post I've read on tumblr. I know a lot of people praise her simplicity, but I just thought it was a little too simple for my tastes. The only other thing that I personally don't 100% agree with is the idea that one must love and appreciate themselves before anyone else can love them. There are a few poems in this collection that encompass this message, for example:""if you are not enough for yourselfyou will never be enoughfor someone else""Personally, the best friends I've made and relationships I've been in were with people who believed in me and saw the best in me when I couldn't. Self-love is a never-ending process. Just because I'm internally struggling with my insecurities doesn't mean that I can't be in a healthy relationship or that a friend, mentor, or significant other can't help point out my strengths to me. It's just a popular concept that I don't really agree with and there are a number of poems in this collection that seem to reiterate it. It is nearly impossible to overcome things like depression, anxiety, addiction and stress without support. To imply that people who aren't happy with themselves or who aren't the best versions of themselves will never be ""enough"" for someone else is silly to me. We all have the ability to inspire someone to love us, even if we don't think we deserve it at the time. Honestly, those were my qualms with the collection. Like I mentioned, there are twelve lovely poems that felt dear to my heart and I appreciate them very much. At the end of the day, though it has stellar reviews on tumblr and goodreads I can't say I was overly impressed by this. It was beautiful but didn't say anything I hadn't heard or read before.

Could not finish it.I've heard it said that if you can't say anything something nice then you should not say it at all. Well, I'm not going to say a lot nice about this collection (of what? Of words?). I don't want to suggest, though, that this is not bad poetry, I want to suggest it is not poetry. It honestly feels like unstructured thoughts with random line breaks to give it the appearance of poetry, when it isn't. There is not more to say as an overview - it feels like something I myself might have wrote as an undergraduate and thought profound in my pretentious naivety. That is not to say this is simply waste paper. Some entire poems are actually quite interesting, and would have made good lines in real poems. Like:''i've had sex' she said,but i don't know what making lovefeels like'Which deserves to be a part of something more complex. The fact that all together there are 15 syllables in this poem means it could have been an interesting section, a line and a bit, of a larger blank verse narrative poem, like something out of 'Death of the Hired Man' by Robert Frost. It feels like it deserves better, but judging from the rest of the collection entire poems are made up of the occasional interesting observation like this - the poet knew she had something there, but did not expand or develop the thought into a poem, but instead put line breaks in and threw it into the manuscript. It's hard to lose the feeling that this was the writing process, another interesting observation is:'she was musicbut he had his ears cut off'The obvious complaint about anatomy aside (you can actually hear things with your ears cut off, just not as well) there is something here that has some kind of merit. What she is getting at here is good, but the execution is completely lacking. Other pieces (I don't want to call them poems) are just trash:'the idea that we areso capable of lovebut still chooseto be toxic'This is just nonsense, overly simplistic at best. Another example:'loneliness is a signyou are in desperate need of yourself'Again, this is at best overly simplistic, and there is nothing more to this piece - so it is a general statement made about the concept of loneliness. The point this is trying to make is that if you are comfortable and in tune with yourself you can never be lonely, but I can't say I think that is very true. Nietzsche's emotional isolation comes readily to mind as a counter-argument to this piece. I am using the word 'piece' instead of 'poem' partly as sarcasm, but few of these poems are titled - seemingly following some sort of Imagist modernist like William Carlos Williams or e.e. cummings (even refusing to use capital letters - I don't like e.e. cummings very much). When they are given titles they add nothing to the content. I know that is not a rule, and not necessary, I'm not saying it is, but if there is an attempt to be profound then the asinine titles just makes it harder to see this as anything other than the work of a poetic amateur who has not put much thought into her output. If we are to treat this book as a collection of poems, there is not (aside from line breaks) any use of poetic technique at all. And the use of line breaks seem arbitrary, neither keeping a consistent metric or playing with the structure of word sounds - like in William Carlos Williams poem 'The Red Wheelbarrow' for example. Between chaotic free verse and short prose essay-things, I could not find any attempt at variation of style and form. The free verse does reflect the chaotic, troubled theme of some of the poems, but I suspect this was not a deliberate reflection and instead the poet is using free verse because that's what she thinks is what makes it a poem. The utter lack of even attempting a clever use of poetic techniques again just screams that this was written by an amateur. Or worse, someone who does not care very much about poetry.To this book's credit, it does deal with some very troubled subjects, alcoholic parents, relationships, abuse, the differences between men and women, and as an emotional catharsis then I suppose others might find this book very comforting. But. Such subjects alone do not justify this book content-wise - as a collection of what are called poems. This can not even be classed as confessional poetry, like say Sylvia Plath or Robert Lowell, because there the emphasis was on the 'I', the personal which had something of the universal - and while that is here, it is not done in the same way. Here the focus was not on the experience, from which the universal might be found through investigation but the experience is still the subject, instead the focus is on on a vague attempt at profundity. Often in a simple, aphoristic way; it reads like very bad motivational posters.I said at the beginning of this review that I could not finish this book, and I don't think I'm missing out on anything by not finishing it.

Okay, fine. I didn't like it. I can see where maybe others would, but it wasn't for me. Let's start by saying that it's marketed as a collection of poetry and prose. Fair enough, I suppose it fits those well enough. But if you're someone who enjoys poetry as a fine art...well, you might find yourself wondering what you're reading once you dive in. One of the things I personally love about poetry is it's vast and variable interpretations - so this isn't a knock on this work as poetry, but rather a warning of it's variability and sometimes seeming disorganization. If you want my honest opinion, it felt like I was reading angsty teen Tumblr posts for 200 pages. Again, I loved Tumblr years ago but feel that I've aged out of it a bit - so maybe that's my problem here with Milk and Honey too, that I'm simply not in the target demographic. Again, this is totally fine! This book's contents are heartfelt, relatable, and seem to be genuine. There are multitudes of people who love and pour over every word of this collection. Simply though, it wasn't for me. What did I think?: This wasn't one that I personally loved but I can see why so many people consider it to be one of the most beautiful things they've ever read. Just because I didn't enjoy it doesn't mean that it can't be your favorite collection ever. Who should read it?: Anyone who's interested in knowing what all of the hype is about, anyone who enjoys heartfelt stories that are painful and genuine, and anyone who wants to experience a different look at prose.

This book has four distinct parts: ‘the hurting’, ‘the loving’, ‘the breaking’ and ‘the healing’. Resembling diary entries of a growing, sensitive girl, the poems hold in their bosoms, sharp jabs and delicate dreams, perplexed emotions and fragile hopes, redeeming realizations and mature homecomings. Kaur is unrestrained in her language as she goes about revealing her innermost responses to abuse, sex, indifference, friendship, love, heartbreak, complexes, abandonment, depression, pain, beauty, self-esteem, recovery, contentment and optimism. And her assertions are, on more occasions than less, startlingly percipient. On a father’s treatment of her daughter, she says, 
""every time youtell your daughteryou yell at herout of loveyou teach her to confuseanger with kindnesswhich seems like a good ideatill she grows up totrust men who hurt hercause they look so muchlike you.""
 Gurgling like a train on rampage, her thoughts find a free flow sans the hindrance of commas or punctuation. They are, albeit, accentuated by intermittent pencil sketches which speak a loud, powerful language of their own.  Her memoirs are likely to find home in score of young women as a voice which is searching yet serene, capable of sending many slivers of invigorating energy into a febrile mind. Because she embraces innocent love and doesn’t wail its vulnerability. Because she neither glamorizes pain nor does she strip it to its ugliest pores; what she does instead, is understand its inevitability and in time, its ephemerality too. 
""your body is a museum of natural disasters can you grasp how stunning that is""
 It may be pertinent to note that the chapters are equally divided into two distressing phases and two uplifting phases. And this structuring of the themes adds a certain sense of full circle to life; a palpable high that is attainable. It leaves a reader to appreciate the significance of arriving at the healing point, irrespective of the point she started from, and the sanctity of staying there. Her core belief, that emerges from these etchings, is that while atrocities cannot be predicted, they can be fought, and while blessings cannot be foreseen, they can be counted.  Written in no sparkling rhymes or heavy words, Kaur’s verses are refreshing and inspiring in their raw and unvarnished form.

Such an intimate collection of poems ☺️ I absolutely adore it.my heart woke me crying last night how can i help i beggedmy heart saidwrite the bookand write a beautiful book of poetry Rupi Kaur did. I devoured this in one sitting. The writing in this book was simply gorgeous!you were so afraid of my voicei decided to beafraid of it tooThe delightful thing about these poems is that they go straight to the heart, to the brain and can leave you shocked. You do not need to spend time analysing ambiguity for a deeper meaning, the meaning is there on face value.This poetry was hard-hitting, raw, powerful, honest, full of emotion and meaning. The writing was engaging and heart-aching, covering topics of femininity, absent parents, violence, love, loss and abuse. It deals with female sexuality and pleasure, the writing erotic at times, Kaur also declares her love for female body hair... both of these topics which are usually rather taboo and topics which women still carry shame about, Rupi Kaur brings empowerment to them, to the female body.This book is split into four parts: the hurting, the loving, the breaking, the healing. Each one dealing with a different topic. All of these exploring some form of love, whether this is familial, self-love or relationship love. Rupi Kaur describes the pain and the beauty of each love, creating a strong force of empathy. I was surprised to learn through reading 'the healing', that Rupi Kaur had trouble writing these poems, and what she did write stemmed from her heartbreak. Rupi Kaur shows us her bitter moments and how sweetness can be found within each one. She is brave for sharing her story, laid out before us. The simplicity of these poems was genius and I absolutely loved the illustrations accompanying them. This is a book that I have picked up, post-it noted, underlined and will continuously reread my favourite poems ( such as -the art of being empty).

Discovering love and themselves.every once in a lifetimedreams can come true,now and then when the stars shineyou meet somebody like you.In Milk and Honey, Rupi Kaur has a way with words, reaching out to a generation living in a vintage era. Summer road trips, Tumblr, and the peak of dark, sad indie music. This was the perfect fit to it all.If we talk about the content, we're going to find ourselves surrounded with basic poetry that actually has the ability to make you feel something. Yes, I do acknowledge that this isn't Sylvia Plath or Nietzsche that we're talking about, but it's one of those reads that -as ""bad"" as it is- can truly move something inside of you.But why? This collection of poetry isn't only about the heartbreak you go through whenever there's a breakup. Kaur also goes into strong topics like abuse, low self-esteem and toxic relationships with verses that are powerful enough to raise awareness.Besides its unoriginal writing and worn-out format, I find this book to be cute and important. Also enjoyable, since it's a pretty fast read that you can devour in one sitting.

Broken into four sections,  Milk and Honey  is the story of hurt, love, pain, and healing. The poems are exquisite thought sometimes they seem  too tumblry  but they really do drive the point home. What I enjoyed most about this book was that it was able to transform the thoughts we all have in our head into beautiful, free-flowing words. It shares such strong emotions in such short words and allows the reader to think and ponder and feel each word. The cute little doodles that mark the pages were so refreshing and really helped imprint the message. Thought I was not a fan of the first book (a little too dark for me) the three following books were filled with uplifting messages of femininity and grace and beauty and acceptance and hardship and perseverance.

What is it about, you might ask? Everything important, I’d respond. Especially to girls who are still growing—essentially, all of us women.This collection of poems concerns trauma, loss, healing, and femininity. Much like it’s cover and title, the whole aesthetic of the book was very minimalist. Each page hosted a different story, and each story was short-spoken yet carried such a imperative reminder. I believe anyone who has gone through pain will be able to relate to Kaur, no matter the gender, age, or scenario. I found myself reading through this book just for the pretty diction. I didn't think I’d get so nostalgic over old wounds. It’s rare to find a piece of writing that truly grips your heart, as if to say look how similar we are! One of my favorite poems is on page 95:i didn't leave becausei stopped loving youi left because the longeri stayed the lessi loved myselfI recently broke up with an amazing boy for the sole purpose of needing to recollect myself before I could give my mind, body, and essence to someone else. This book couldn't have landed in my hands at any better moment. It is broken up into four parts, taking us through a journey with Kaur as our narrator. Each chapter tells a different tale of sorrow, but like most awful things there tends to be a self-revolution towards the end.

After reading the book, I had to take a break to regain my knowledge of English grammar even if it isn't excellent. I knew my record of reading four good books consequently was going to be jinxed. I know I'm not fan of poetry but the book goes beyond my limit to tolerate crap and I'm in minorities once again.I can't say that the poetry is filled with craziness because it's not. It's about the pain that women around the world endure, about which I think more awareness is spreading day-by-day. Now, the main question lies why I didn't like the book at all. Firstly, it's badly written. The grammatical errors and the arrangement of sentences makes it look as if a kid has written it. Sometimes, I couldn't understand the poems at all. (No, I'm not dumb if you have doubt). Secondly, it's exaggerated and obnoxious. I know you want to make us understand your pain but demeaning someone else in the process is not the way. Like there's one poem where it's literally written that (view spoiler)[a person is not treating his current gf properly because he misses his ex. It's fine that he misses his ex but the comparison made between his ex and current gf is full of crap. The poem is written in such a way that his ex is perfect goddess whereas his current gf is nowhere near her. That's bullshit. No one is perfect and no one will be because humans were never meant to be fit into the standards of others. (hide spoiler)] It's awkward to mention but I'll try to sum it up in a better way. The poems don't have a proper line between love and lust. Sometimes, it gave narcissism vibes. I really appreciate the works done for feminism but sometimes people don't get it. No matter how much one tries, none can experience what victims go through. This is one of the books which tries to show pain but miserably fails. It lacks the maturity and rawness of the pain and healing. Not to mention that the sexualised images actually lessens the quality of the book. Thanks for taking trouble to read the review.

I hated writing poem analyses because I was extremely bad at it; I just always interpreted the poems different from how my teacher interpreted them. And I was also, and still am, really bad at writing poems myself which is why every time I heard the word poem in class, I was about to just leave the room. Due to that I never really even thought about trying to just read some poems at home without having to analyze them or continue writing them in the style of the poet. By now, my time in school is over though and at the beginning of this year I wrote down some ‘reading goals’ I want to achieve this year because I want to challenge myself and want to stop always reading the same kind of books. One of the points on this list is “read a poetry book”, so when my sister came home with a copy of ‘Milk and Honey’ a couple of weeks ago, I just knew that I would have to read it.Before I started reading ‘Milk and Honey’, I absolutely didn’t have any idea what it was about. I didn’t look up any information about it on the internet and so I just went straight into it. To be honest, I thought it would take me some time to get into this book and it wouldn’t immediately made me feel something. But after the first couple of poems, I was already hooked. I wasn’t touched by all the texts (poems and prose) in this book but there were a couple that really, really touched me and were quite thought-provoking. There were some poems in here that were only a few words long but still touched me so much that I had to put the book down for a couple of minutes to just think about them. ‘Milk and Honey’ is truly a great book and it deserves 4 out of 5 stars. I never thought I would actually enjoy it that much but I’m really glad my sister brought this one home with her.",47,default,['read-in-2017']

I love poetry, and perhaps this book is nice and fresh for some, but this felt like beginner's level poetry for me. I did however LOVE the illustrations in this book, and if they were a separate book I would have given them five stars alone. To me, most of these poems were just a collection of scattered words and random metaphors. The pattern of the few poems I did enjoy were a bit longer than the rest of the poem, and I realize if Kaur had developed some of her messages I might have actually enjoyed more of her poems. I really appreciated the messages Kaur attempted to spread, but when a poem had six words, and three word breaks, it just felt more in the format of a poem rather than being an actual poem. (view spoiler)[There were some poems like:“youare your ownsoul mate.”Again, great message, but if I knew this is the poetry that has been such highly praised, I would not have picked up this book in the first place.And then rare poems like this, which was probably my most enjoyed poem (If only the novel included more of these):“you tell mei am not like most girlsand learn to kiss me with your eyes closedsomething about the phrase—something abouthow i have to be unlike the womeni call sisters in order to be wantedmakes me want to spit your tongue outlike i am supposed to be proud you picked meas if i should be relieved you thinki am better than them”The message of this one was not only so clearly conveyed, but it was well developed, unlike many of the other poems.

I've read many comments saying that this book doesn't deserve a low rating because the author poured her raw feelings into this book, and so it shouldn't be judged. Most authors do that.

**2.5 stars**you might not have been my first lovebut you were the love that madeall the other loves irrelevant
It feels sort of ironic when you discover an author from your native land quite after the rest of the world already had, while asking you to read it, to which you obviously turned a deaf year. And the fact that I started reading her three simultaneously, whether I will like them or not, I am indebted to “Tonight’s Show Starring Jimmy Fallon”. It was in there that I found Ms. Kaur is of a Punjab origin (as many of my favorite regional authors), who made it to Toronto with her family at 5. Actually, it was pretty much her story along with her inspiring persona that told me to take up her works.Alas, if only it was what it promised to be! In a world of Instagram poets, I expected more from someone whose all three books have made it to the NYT Bestsellers’ List… and then I figured it out. In a world where anything which is even slightly unfathomable is ofttimes regarded as pseudo-intellectual, maybe it was “astute” to play safe with words everyone can understand. And in no ways are her words ineffective, on the contrary, quite sedulously straightforward:
sex takes the consent of twoif one person is lying there not doing anything cause they are not readyor not in the mood or simply don’t want toyet the other is having sexwith their body it’s not loveit is rape
I can’t remember when I read it this empirically, the last time. Still. Well, I know that gender inequality is still very much in prevalence, and women are being oppressed all over the world psychologically and physically(actually, more in third-world countries like ours, I feel), just as they were since the dawn of our so-called civilization. But that doesn’t necessitate to be told the same thing over and over, when there’s pretty much no change of language too. You can reiterate the truth as many times as you want, but that’s not going to make it authentic. The book has importance only because it doesn’t feel like mollycoddling the morals that comes from the scrapbook of a pseudo-feminist.I’m glad really that Ms. Kaur made it to the top, everyone has the right to give voice to his or her thoughts and endeavors. And she does it quite well, but not as exceptionally as you would expect from such a charismatic and believed-to-be-capable poet…for you are bound to come across dozens of equivalent quotes if you are addicted to social media anyway. These are just a bit more burnished, and the poet’s prowess is clearly evident in her lackluster yet eloquent sketches. I won’t suggest you to read it, for it’s more probable that you have already read it. Even without moving to the second page, if you know what I mean.(I actually remember seeing all of these quotes even before I read the book…sometimes I even spoke some myself. It’s not creditable even for folks like us.) Take this:
you whisper i love you what you mean is i don’t want you to leave

Case in point: I downloaded this book of poetry from the library, on a lark, never having heard of either the book or the author before. Then I come to find out that Rupi Kaur’s Milk and Honey (2014) was on the NYT Best Seller List for 77 weeks, has sold over 2.5 million copies and been translated into at least 25 languages! Alas! The book is not really very good. So how do we explain Rupi Kaur’s success? Well, let’s just say that Rupi is a genius at self-promotion. She was a relatively successful “InstaPoet”—that is, a writer of poetry who achieves a following on Instagram—when, in March of 2015, she posted a photo of herself menstruating: lying down, viewed from the back, with a large spot of blood on her pj’s and a small spot of blood on the sheets. Instagram took down the photo, she protested; her followers reacted with outrage, Instagram put the photo back up.Here is Ms. Kaur’s original statement of protest, which no doubt contributed to the outrage:
 i will not apologize for not feeding the ego and pride of misogynist society that will have my body in an underwear but not be okay with a small leak. when your pages are filled with countless photos/accounts where women (so many who are underage) are objectified. pornified. and treated less than human. thank you.
 And thus a star—if not a poet—was born.I didn’t hate the book. It has its moments. It is composed of four sections--”the hurting,” “the loving,” “the breaking,” “the healing”--and more than a handful of poems—almost all in the first and fourth sections—aren’t half bad. Ms. Kaur is a Sikh whose family immigrated to Canada from India, and she is at her best when she either 1) describes the plight of women dominated by men who are distant and violent, or 2) celebrates her own particular ethnic beauty, glorying in her dark skin and bountiful body hair. (Kaur’s illustrations, which accompany these poems, are often good too: my favorite is of a woman whose luxuriant leg hair forms a literal garden—of mushrooms, of leaves, of flowers, etc.)Still, not all of the first and fourth section are good, and almost all the free verse in the second and third sections is bad: sappy love poetry followed by cliché break-up poetry that could be produced by any intelligent sixteen-year-old girl. And the prose pieces? Even worse. Nothing but the unedited diary entries of a semi-intelligent teenage girl.But let’s end on a high note. First, three effective short poems about women and men:
every time youtell your daughteryou yell at herout of loveyou teach her to confuseanger with kindnesswhich seems like a good ideatill she grows upto trust men who hurt hercause they look so muchlike you*you pinned my legs tothe groundwith your feetand demandedI stand up*our kneespried openby cousinsand unclesand menour bodies touchedby all the wrong peoplethat even in a bed of safetywe are afraid
And one longer poem (called “women of color”) about a new definition of female beauty:
my issue with what they consider beautifulis their concept of beautycenters around excluding peopleI find hair beautifulwhen a woman wears itlike a garden on her skinthat is the definition of beautybig hooked nosespointing upward to the skylike they’re risingto the occasionskin the color of the earthmy ancestors planted crops onto fed a lineage of women withthighs thick as tree trunkseyes like almondsdeep hooded with convictionthe rivers of punjabflow through my bloodstream sodon’t tell me my womenaren’t as beautiful asthe ones in your countryour backstell storiesno bookshave the spine to carry

A quick look at other reviews and ratings shows lots of people talking about how so un-poetry like this collection is, but I'd venture to say that comes from a rather narrow or limited view of poetry. Is this very flowery and lyrical? Not at all. However, it's impact comes in capturing incredibly complex moments and topics in just a few lines. Perhaps the most impressive thing about this collection is in fact the way Kaur budgets her words. (Also, line breaks in poems are significant and create rhythm and flow. Lots of these reviews think they are being funny about line breaks, but they are a pretty big thing in poetry...? Like...?)I loved reading about Kaur's decision to write all in lowercase and only with periods, trying to capture a language she couldn't quiet express herself in. That feeling of having a language so close to your life but so far from mastery is one I *know* and for her to capture that and then create an entire collection in that style was lovely. It also contributed to this fluid way the collection read. Milk and Honey is an apt title for more reasons than one, but it also captures the way small poems flow into others, sometimes slowing the overall rhythm with a thicker poem. While I loved the simplicity and more than once felt choked up by the themes, my one critique would be that perhaps it could've been tightened just a bit to save some of the shorter poems from feeling repetitive. Overall, though, super simple and thus impressive in its impact and loveliness. our backstell storiesno books havethe spine tocarry--women of color",42,default,"['2017', 'poetry']"

I did not include any of those poems in this review. Despite the average rating I thoroughly enjoyed this book, particularly chapters two and four since they did not depress me like her first and third chapter. I do recommend that instead of starting with this book, listen to her recite her poems on Youtube, which I have linked at the end of the review, because they are much better, and my favourite. (and one of the short poems here is actually a part of her poem ""liberation"")This collection has many themes, sexuality, abuse, femininity, violence, lost love, forgotten memories, and feminism. I did not even try to look for it, it popped up on the previous image.The chapters were:the hurting: this one shows all abuse and the effects it has on the victims. Rape, verbal abuse and physical abuse form partners or family members. This chapter might make you sick to the stomach once you read how some ""people""will hurt others for their own sake, without a care in the world for the damage it will cause their victims, I read short snippets at a time, it was too much to read in one sitting. the loving: learning to love yourself and others after what has happened. This is the first step to recovery, loving oneself and realizing it is not one's fault for what happened, and with that trying to move on. Such a beautiful part that also dealt with love and feminism, and hoe degrading others will not make one feel better, but will drive them further into themselves. the breaking: basically it is almost as if regressing on all the progress, remembering those bad things, but there is no stop in the fighting, this is the part where one becomes stronger. the healing: the final step, finally saving oneself. A happy ending after all endured. I was not the biggest fan of the writing, nor the length since I prefer longer poems, but some of these together, would form a brilliant slam poem. Her writing is simple and to the point. Per example, the poem below is about how if we are not the ones succeeding we will not approve nor cheer for someone else succeeding in our stead. If she publishes other works, I will most definitely read them. She is not W.B. Yeats, nor Jose Marti, but in her writing, I find a truth that makes me want to come for more. It is her raw honesty, she will not hide what she means, she will not use metaphors or allegory to make u find various interpretations, no, she will show us what she means and what she thinks of it. And there is nothing more perfect than honesty told through poetry. This is her performing her poetry on Youtube. All beautiful. broken english.

“How you love yourself ishow you teach othersto love you”― Rupi Kaur, Milk and Honey
I try to express only my most honest opinion in a spoiler free way. If you feel anything in my review is a spoiler and is not already hidden in spoiler brackets please let me know. Thank you.This is a collection of poems about love and loss and being a woman.It was short. Thats the first thing I think when I think of this book. Honestly, I don't think poetry is really my thing. But I gave it a shot. It wasn't bad, and some of it was even uplifting. But I don't see myself persuing much poetry in the future.
How I choose my rating:1* Did not finish, or hated it but forced myself to finish.2** Didn't really like it. Didn't hate it but not sure why I finished it other then for some closure.3*** I liked it. I had some issues with it, but as a whole it was good. I probably won't reread again ever, but there is a chance I might finish the series. (If part of one) But if not it's not a huge loss.4**** I really liked this book. Maybe not a work of genius, but highly entertaining. I might reread this again, and I will finish the series. (If part of one) I would recommend to those I know hold interest in this books content.5***** I loved this book. I found little to no issues with it at all. I will definitely be rereading this and probably more than once. I will finish the series and reread it multiple times. (If part of one) I will recommend this book to EVERYONE!!!!

Every time you tell your daughter you yell at her out of love you teach her to confuse anger with kindness which seems like a good idea till she grows up to trust men who hurt her cause they look so much like you- to fathers with daughtersYou might not have been my first love but you were the love that made all the other loves irrelevantWhen you are broken and he has left you do not question whether you were enough the problem was you were so enough he was not able to carry itWhat terrifies me most is how we foam at the mouth with envy when others succeed but sigh in relief when they are failing.

This book is for the broken, the lost, the love that comes and go, the struggle, the hardships, the victims of abused, just everyone. I believe everyone's broken in their own way. We can't see and we barely feel but it's there. We might never face each others hardships but all we need is each other. We mend each other. Comfort each other. Being there for one another is just enough. That understanding very much needed. I hardly read poetry. I even can count by fingers on how many of those I have read.

It practically took me over a year and half to finally pen this review down! Well, what do I say? This book was wildly underwhelming! I had such expectations at the time of picking it up. I thought I was in for a treat but was I wrong. Let’s just say that this is so underwhelming that I wasn’t even bothered to write a decent review for quite a while. But now I am finally getting around to it but honestly speaking, I’d rather pass if not for my OCD!!So, the book is actually divided into multiple sections but there isn’t really a theme to it for doing so. The poems and pieces about anything are placed just about anywhere. And a lot of them are stated in a very questionable way and are debate worthy bcz they are pretty open to interpretation. I found myself not agreeing to a few of the pieces.While reading this book I found another problem that isn’t just limited to this book but is applicable to a lot of such poetry books. The problem is that none of these books have even a single negative poem. You know how they are all loving and pure and full of insight and teaching? I wonder why none of them deal with any of the more human emotions like anger or hate or vengefulness or jealousy or anything like that for the matter. Why are they all so shiny white? Why aren’t they about how a real person hurts? Where is the black? The grey? In these terms, I think The road of us was much better, although AFTER publishing my review for that book I realized what a phony, lousy and shallow person the author is in real life which kinda ruined the book for me completely. Every poetry book I have ever read till date talks about “loving yourself first before anyone else” in one way or the other and they all shun the idea of someone completing another person. How and why is that wrong? Why are the authors trying to sell us the idea that nobody is capable of loving us apart from ourselves? Where did all the notions of love and soulmate go to? How come self love is the only thing left? And why do none of these books talk about a person who is incapable of loving themselves? Oh sure, they preach that yeah girl, love yourself but why do none of them talk about a person who just can’t do that? Is the idea of a person who can never truly love themselves so impossible? Is the idea of someone coming in your life and giving you a love that you couldn’t give to yourself so abhorrent? Most of all, why do these books sound like they are preaching? I mean let me ask, all these authors being as young as they are (most in their mid to late twenties), how come they have seen most everything in life? And alright fine they might have the knowledge but how and why do all these authors sound like the angels descended to the Earth to write these books bcz dammit why do they have no negative emotions? And why do the essence of all these insta-poetry books is limited to ""YASS QUEEN""?? Building up only women? Where is the raw & real side of everything that poetry is supposed bring?Yeah, I find it EXTREMELY phoney, the way these authors write and it doesn’t sit well with me. All this pearly white goodness of the heaven bullshit leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I am sorry Rupi, love, we’re not gonna work out I think.26/12/18: RTC",23,default,[]

However, the whole message beside the book is really beautiful and I was able to read the whole thing!I know that this kind of poetry can be judged as too easy since it's sometimes only a quick and simple sentence, but since a lot of them actually touched me I think that this book was really good. Poetry is here to make us feel things and that's what happened with Milk and Honey. So it's good enough for me! Also, the illustrations were absolutely gorgeous and I wanted to take pics of everyone of them.The messages in this book are really important and even though I already knew everything, I think it's great that the author wrote them.

It wasn't even unconventional poetry but rather bits of scribbling and illustrations on some pages. The idea was present there but it was scattered and fragmented all over the book. The author doesn't explore those ideas and hence, they remain underdeveloped! The book has a potential but in my opinion that potential hasn't been stretched to its highest. I've watched Rupi performing slang poems and she is absolutely amazing at that. I suggest you to watch Rupi's Ted Talks. The few longest paragraphs in this book would make a beautiful and heart-touching slang poem if Rupi was to perform it on stage. However, she could have worked more on this book and make her ideas more concrete. If you want to read this book, I encourage you to do so even if I gave it a 2 stars because the author presents some beautiful ideas.

The book itself it split into 4 chapters, the first chapter explores abuse, the second looks at falling in love, the third deals with loss and the fourth is about healing. This collection of poems is a stunning look into life, love and loss.you were a dragon long beforehe came around and saidyou could flyyou will remain a dragonlong after he's leftOkay, first of all, I have to open this review by saying I LOVED this book, but I completely understand why people may evoke the completely opposite reaction. It's a love or hate kinda thing, I get it, but I find beauty in simplicity - look at my bookstagram photos for crying out loud! From the very first page, I felt myself connecting with these poems and with Kaur's experiences. I myself may not have been a victim of abuse, but as a woman I can understand where such feelings would come from - the suggestion that your body exists merely to please someone else. I may not have resonated as strongly with the first chapter, ""the hurting"", but the rest of the chapters felt as though they were written for me, and that is how I feel poetry should be. You either connect with it or you don't.The second chapter ""the loving"" explores those heady days of new relationships and falling in love. You would expect these poems to be more romantic, and while a lot of them were, some just weren't. You can see how some of the hurting and the abuse have been carried forward into her new relationship. The third chapter ""the breaking"" quickly contrasts the previous with heart-wrenching descriptions of what it feels like to go through a breakup and the loneliness that follows.""the healing"" chapter was my favourite, just full of uplifting, inspiring, thoughtful pieces.The poems are so powerful and full of emotion and they really touched me. It's a book I can't wait to revisit and read more slowly, as initially I feel like I just devoured it. I did re-read certain passages at the time, but overall, I'd like to immerse myself in it again.

This was such a beautiful collection of poems. I don't usually read poems, in fact this is probably the first poetry book I own. I've read very few poems, but I kept stumbling upon this book over and over so I finally decided to read it. And I am so glad that I did! The poems are so well written, and the best thing about it is that everyone can relate to it. The poems are broken into four parts - hurt, love, pain, and healing, shows every phase of life through these strong, and beautifully written poems.The poems are written in a very simple way, but the message it gives, the impact it has is  very strong. I couldn't relate to some parts, like the hurt, where the subject was too dark and heavy, but still there were some poems which really touched my heart. But rest of the three parts were beautiful, some parts which I could completely relate to, and the last part which was very inspirational and uplifting.

Milk and Honey
 because the blurb and the reviews I’ve seen all promised me a great read. I’m sorry, but I don’t think it deserved the huge hype.I admit that Kaur is a bold and very honest writer. This was her truth in the pages and I greatly appreciated that she spoke about all the hurt, the beauty, and how to endure life’s cruelties. It was as if she was holding my heart in her hand and squeezing it.But the writing wasn’t that impressive. I didn’t like the idea that every line in the poems started in lowercase letters. Also, her choice of words weren’t that exquisitely weaved. They were too simple for my liking. The concepts of most of the poems were things that you could’ve easily read from Facebook pages and tumblr posts. They seemed unoriginal and derivative.Here’s an example:
“sex takes the consent of twoif one person is lying there not doing anythingcause they are not readyor not in the moodor simply don't want toyet the other is having sexwith their body it's not loveit is rape”
Despite my negative views on it, I admit that this is a good book to read when you’re feeling down and are in need of a friend. It reminded me to look at life as a canvas filled with colors and textures that would uplift you or agitate you.",20,default,"['read-in-2017', 'feminism', 'poetry']"

Me encantó la poesía de Rupi Kaur porque no es llana y pretenciosa como esas típicas frases de tumblr que pretenden ser poéticas. Ella realmente es profunda con lo que plantea y se nota que lo ha pensado y trabajado bastante. Muestra de dónde provienen sus ideas y las va desarrollando a lo largo del libro de una forma fantástica. Habla de temas muy importantes, como las raíces propias, violaciones, y la necesidad que quererse a uno mismo. Y la estructura que separa al libro en cuatro partes me gustó mucho porque enfatiza los momentos en que la autora pensaba una o aquella cosa y son momentos de la vida por los que la mayoría pasamos. Es muy crudo en muchos aspectos (y por lo que se llega a saber de Rupi Kaur, está claro que ha tenido una vida bastante complicada, así que esa crudeza está justificada y tiene bastante sentido). Es muy explícita con respecto al sexo, algo que a mí me incomodó más de una vez (because I'm such a prude), pero lo entiendo perfectamente por lo que le tocó vivir y porque entre las ideas que defiende está eso de romper tabúes (y claro, el sexo es uno de ellos). El libro es absolutamente feminista y hubo muchas cosas al respecto que me encantaron, pero hubo un par de otras que no mucho; y es precisamente porque yo no termino de encajar con el feminismo de hoy en día. Siento que hay un culto al cuerpo bastante innecesario. Que sí, que las mujeres podemos ir por ahí como se nos pegue en gana y no por eso los acosadores deben sentirse en el derecho de perseguirnos. Es completamente cierto. Pero luego hay nimiedades sobre si es nuestro derecho dejarnos el vello de las piernas o si los hombres pueden andar sin camisa nosotras también. Y en fin, que hay cosas más urgentes en las que centrarse; por ejemplo: las relaciones tóxicas, las canciones machistas, la educación que enseña a las niñas desde pequeñas que su rol en la sociedad consiste en estar casada, tener hijos y contentar a su marido, y que tenemos que saber cocinar para él y lavar y planchar y todas esas cosas. Y además está el hecho de que el nuevo feminismo es también bastante cruel con el género masculino. Nos centramos en los estereotipos que rodean a la mujer, pero olvidamos que el hombre también sufre de ellos. Después de todo, ellos son los violadores, los acomodados que esperan la cena caliente sin mover un dedo, los que nos pegan e insultan, los que se creen superiores, los que se burlan de nosotras por ser sensibles y superficiales, los que tienen que mantenernos porque somos inútiles. Pero eso es cuestión de tradición. A ellos también les enseñaron que no pueden mostrar sus sentimientos ni llorar, que tienen que trabajar para proveer a su familia porque ese es el deber del hombre, que ellos son la cabeza del hogar, que es de campeones acostarse con muchas chicas, que no pueden meterse en la cocina porque eso es para mujeres. La verdad no creo que tengan la culpa, tan sólo les enseñaron a estar en el bando en que hay menos opresión. Y claro, entiendo que la visión de Rupi Kaur sobre los hombres se haya visto bastante mancillada por haber sido violada y por la casi inexistente relación con su padre; pero a veces sentí que estaba demasiado ocupada tratado de convencer a las mujeres de que no era su culpa ser maltratadas por los hombres y no hacía distinciones en que los hombres buenos también existen.Ahora, sí que me encantó el énfasis que le puso a la idea de que lo primero es amarse a uno mismo, tener una buena relación con nosotros, apreciar nuestra soledad y descubrir nuestras virtudes y defectos y aprender a querernos aun así. Es que me parece trascendental sobre todo en estos tiempos en que las niñas andan buscando a alguien que las complete, que sea lo que ellas no son para sentirse llenas porque tienen pánico a quedarse solas. Y así se casan y arruinan sus vidas atándose a alguien, engañándose a sí mismas pensando que los aman, sólo porque les parece una mejor idea que morir en soledad. Ese es el mensaje que más rescato de este poemario: 《fallin love with your solitude》",19,default,"['books-i-own', 'read-2018', '4-stars', 'feminism', 'poetry']"

'how is it so easy for youto be kind to people he askedmilk and honey drippedfrom my lips as i answeredcause people have notbeen kind to me'
I realised that I have a preference to deep dark poetry. Dark thoughts and experiences. I enjoy reading about people's experiences, it's like all this anger, sadness and pain being scratched onto the pages.Its a part of the author and I can't get enough of that.
 'neither of us is happybut neither of us wants t leaveso we keep breaking one anotherand calling it love' 
Rupi Kaur just has a way with words, I can't even explain it.She inspires me to write.Even though I am no poet but her poetry makes me want to give it a shot.It's a whole different experience when you read something and you can totally relate and you feel like the words are your words that you never knew how to express.This is one I would definitely want on my shelf because I don't this is the last time I will read it.
'I can't tell if my mother isterrified or in love with myfather it all looks the same'

I understand there has been a rise in ‘modern-contemporary’ poems, or ‘tumblr-speak.’ From what I’ve seen people either love or hate it.I personally really enjoyed it. I’m by no means a poetry connoisseur but I believe poetry should be a very personal thing. I care little about the formatting and more about the words themselves. For me, poetry is always a hard thing to review because it is so personal, so this is going to be short and simplePros:This addresses some really powerful and harrowing topics I believe are very relevant to women today. Again, very personal to even read and I think Rupi Kaur managed to convey of difficult ideas and emotions in very short worksI liked the variety both in length and style with the poems and I thought the illustrations fit very well.A strong theme of self-confidence and finding strength in one’s self ran throughout this entire collection—each section builds upon it until it cultivates in the last fourth. Overall, I think it’s a very important message and I enjoyed the way it was handled. Cons:This did get a little repetitive. The collection is split into four sections and I couldn’t help but feel like perhaps each section was a little longer than it needed to be.

The written words narrate the intimate journey of a young woman through the newness of love, abuse, bitter breakup and healing, in a series of simple, direct, short and soul pouring poems, bits of narrative or advice to the reader.Kaur's approach speaks to many and managed to pull poetry from a niche to becoming a modern hype, carried by social media. That is undoubtedly a great achievment and I don't want to take away from that. It made poetry accessibly and wakened an entire generation to appreciate this kind of literature again, which I see as a great contribution. Many criticize the new format for abandoning the rules of poetry but I disagree. The beauty of art is it‘s freedom in expression and development. Kaur found a format that could transport her words to people of her age, which is something the big majority of poems fail at. Being modern is not a bad thing, failing to develop for the purpose of holding on to rules that worked decades ago but don‘t do so anymore, prohibits progression.Abuse was a topic that was briefly covered, surely provocative and the strongest chapter in my opinion, but the biggest part of the book indulged more in love and almost erotic thoughts. That probably speaks to a wide range of women, since it‘s a trend spreading through different genres and evokes enthusiasm.However I simply consider myself not the right audience.",19,default,[]

""if you were born with the weakness to fall you were born with the strength to rise.""
I'm clearly just in a poetry mood tonight. I've been wanting to read Milk & Honey for the longest time because a lot of people consider this their favorite book and rave about it constantly, and to be honest I'm a little underwhelmed by this unfortunately. This poetry collection is divided into four sections: the hurting, the loving, the breaking, and the healing. 
""I am a museum full of art but you had your eyes shut.""
Don't get me wrong, some poems were really gorgeous and thought provoking but the majority of the poems in this story felt very simplistic and read more like tweets or tumblr posts than actual poems. Some of the ""poems"" were just so basic and unoriginal. For example: ""Your voice alone drives me to tears."" Or: ""i don't want to be friends i want all of you"" To me those don't feel like poems but just random thoughts that the author was having while writing this. All of the poems in the beginning were extremely depressing and very focused on this very personal experience I'm sure, for the author. Then the second part was all centered on a break up, and the poems were a little too dramatic and over the top for me, I didn't connect with any of it. I know it's nitpicking but I really hated how the 'i' is always lowercase it would drive me crazy. I also didn't like how some poems were so short, only one single thought and so simple and then some were so long, paragraph after paragraph - it all just felt so sloppy and inconsistent. 
""Our backs tell stories no books have the spine to carry.""
The best thing about this collection of poems is the positive message it has about feminism and rape culture. Those poems were so so so important and beautifully-worded. I think 'the healing' section was my favorite part of all of them. It had the most inspirational poems and quotes. I love the poem about wanting to apologize to women for calling them pretty when they are so much more than that - we should be calling women things like 'resilient' or 'extraordinary' instead of just 'pretty'. I also love the poem talking about how it's inappropriate to talk about your period in public, but it's ok to sell what's between a woman's legs, but the nature of our body is too ugly for the world to handle. Really powerful, amazing feminist shit that I love. I think my favorite poem is about having a balanced life, so I will end this review here:
“i don’t know what living a balanced life feels likewhen i am sadi don’t cry i pourwhen i am happyi don’t smile i glowwhen i am angryi don’t yell i burnthe good thing about feeling in extremes is when i love i give them wings but perhaps that isn't such a good thing cause they always tend to leave and you should see me when my heart is broken i don't grievei shatter”

That was how I felt when I finished this book. Thorugh this set of poetry, I was exposed to the true power of writing. It is true, words can change you. ""Milk and Honey"" was a book I had exceptionally high hopes on, and that could either turn out horribly or extremely well. Turns out, it was between the gray lines. Each poem was deep and sensitive. In short lines, Rupi Kaur was able to express her thoughts on love, pain, loss, drama, and femininity; however, I didn't really think her ""poems"" were really poems at all. I thought they were just sentences and Rupi Kaur just pressed the enter bar every few words. I also didn't really understand why she didn't capitalize any letter in any of her poems. I don't know...it might just be the authors own writing choice. Nonetheless, this is a worthy read for those of you that are looking for a way to escape and a way to be comforted. This book gives it all. “i want to apologize to all the women i have called beautifulbefore i’ve called them intelligent or bravei am sorry i made it sound as thoughsomething as simple as what you’re born withis all you have to be proud ofwhen you have broken mountains with your wit from now on i will say things likeyou are resilient, or you are extraordinarynot because i don’t think you’re beautifulbut because i need you to knowyou are more than that” ""I didn't leave because I stopped loving you, I left because the longer I stayed the less I loved myself.” ",18,default,[]

I was interested in reading this after seeing screenshots of some of the poems online, but there were only a few more poems in addition to those three or four that really stood out to me. Most of them sound/read like those ""quotes"" or sayings you can find so easily on social media accounts today. So it's easy to say her work isn't art to be called poetry at all. But saying that is just subscribing to an elitist and limiting definition of what art is. True, I felt that her use of form (placing of line breaks) often distracted me, and I thought that many of the poems read like ""fillers"" that interrupted both the rhythm and mood of the poems as a whole collection. But I think they suffered from rather poor arrangement or organisation to fill a large ""collection"" of poems. Most of all, I appreciated the poems for their message and intention, and the poems that feel genuine and honest are truly beautiful. Rupi Kaur discussed difficult topics like abuse, rape and the need for self-love and self-respect (esp among women). Writing about these topics in spare, straightforward language made her poems come across honest, bold and hard-hitting. I like the simple one she wrote 'defining rape', and from that one I realized many of her poems /sound/ better than read, like in spoken word. Maybe that could take away the distracting use of line breaks?? Very likely though, a big problem is I can't/don't relate to a bunch of those struggles, but... nevertheless I felt like the poems I liked offered me new perspectives or new language to think about such experiences. Like the one about talking to her father on the phone. Or the one about the fire in her belly and being tough to swallow. Simplicity is welcome especially because we don't need more obstruction in our attempts to understand other experiences. And the ones I felt were like fillers were poems that didn't really offer much in terms of perspective and connection. So I think this collection suffered most from the organisation (sorry I can't think of a better word for this) of the poems, because there were a bit too many 'okay' poems almost literally breaking up the sincerity of the beautiful poems. Either way, I think it's wonderful she and her writing really connected with lots of readers! That kind of connection and resonance really is what literature is all about. Edit: I just came across this buzzfeed article (https://www.buzzfeed.com/chiaragiovan...) that kinda critiques this collection of poems, and it (plus its comments) was insightful about all the messy politics. I honestly would love to read something by writers of colour that does not focus so much on race or political issues generally (why not something happier? we're not all or always suffering...), so that their work won't continually go under scrutiny for cultural 'authenticity' and marketability... ugh :///Edit again: I just watched Rupi Kaur's TED talk, and it was interesting and I think conveyed the sincerity of her poetry ten times better than this collection. Makes me think I was quite right about me enjoying her poems better as spoken word! Haha",17,default,[]

Each chapter focused on honest descriptions of what it means to be a woman, and to be human. While the focus of this book is on women's lived experience, there is enough insight and beauty here for everyone. I read some pages three and  four times, because I had to digest all of the wonderful elements they entailed. The illustrations are minimalist but compliment the words, leaving enough space for you to fill in the rest.

I read the entire book in a two hour sitting and was refreshed by all of the greatness staring back at me on the pages. She covers a variety of topics, including  love, abuse, parents, and growth. Each poem inspired a moment of reflection in myself, and nourished my soul. I would recommend this to readers who enjoy poetry, feminism, and powerful words.

I almost felt as if I was reading a journal of some sort. Something far too personal and intimate for me to be reading. Kaur pours her heart out on every page, and I'm just so beyond grateful that she decided to share her sanctuary of hurt and healing with us. Sometimes, I did [foolishly] wonder as to why she wrote in such depth about her past lover(s), and then it hit me that this was her recovery process. The words that lay on the pages was her way of healing herself. In whatever way, writing had helped her. I know many people comment on the fact that this book of poetry is similar to that of 'Tumblr Poetry'. I agree, but I don't necessarily think that is a bad thing. I believe that words are art, and no matter what platform it is on (and no matter how angsty it is), it is still that: art. Of course I didn't resonate with a few poems, and couldn't quite connect with them on the level I did with others, but I still loved it despite that. The sketches were so beautiful, and complemented her words so well. I loved the poems which promoted feminism and the idea that women are art, and they were so well done. I genuinely think this is the book that I will turn to after I suffer my first heartbreak. ",17,default,[]

Poetry is tricky to judge-for me it's like a someone's desperate whispered confession, a peek in someone's half forgotten dream or a thought that comes to you while lying in bed on a Saturday morning. Considering that weird perspective, I simply can't say that a poem is complete bulls*it (if it was prose, I really wouldn't hesitate), but this book was reaaaaally close to that line. Apart from not liking the form ( although I have nothing against postmodern structure of a poem, but this was too bland and random) I utterly disliked the strong presence the ""feminist"" thought that would feel at home in a Tumblr post (not the right wave of feminism for me, sorry guys) and the fact that I felt that most of the things she said in her poems were like something belonging on a mediocre quote photo from FB, which I despise.

I'm not sure how to explain it, but I wanted this book of poetry to be more relatable to me as it was with many others but I'm not sure if it was a failure to connect myself to the poems, but I didn't find myself as captivated into the words as I have been when I have read other books of poetry. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book above others I have read of poetry. I personally see this book as overhyped and as much as the words were wonderfully written, they didn't seem to tether any emotion into myself as I read; I just kind of read the words and wasn't as into it as normally I find myself when reading poetry.
